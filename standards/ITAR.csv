127.12,"a general policy. the department strongly encourages the disclosure of information to the directorate of defense trade controls by persons that believe they may have violated any export control provision of the arms export control act, or any regulation, order, license, or other authorization issued under the authority of the arms export control act. the department may consider a voluntary disclosure as a mitigating factor in determining the administrative penalties, if any, that should be imposed. failure to report a violation may result in circumstances detrimental to u.s. national security and foreign policy interests, and will be an adverse factor in determining the appropriate disposition of such violations. b limitations. 1 the provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to the directorate of defense trade controls for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under part 128 of this subchapter concerning a violation of the export control provisions of the arms export control act and these regulations. 2 the provisions of this section apply only when information is received by the directorate of defense trade controls for review prior to such time that either the department of state or any other agency, bureau, or department of the united states government obtains knowledge of either the same or substantially similar information from another source and commences an investigation or inquiry that involves that information, and that is intended to determine whether the arms export control act or these regulations, or any other license, order, or other authorization issued under the arms export control act has been violated. 3 the violation s in question, despite the voluntary nature of the disclosure, may merit penalties, administrative actions, sanctions, or referrals to the department of justice to consider criminal prosecution. in the latter case, the directorate of defense trade controls will notify the department of justice of the voluntary nature of the disclosure, although the department of justice is not required to give that fact any weight. the directorate of defense trade controls has the sole discretion to consider whether voluntary disclosure, in context with other relevant information in a particular case, should be a mitigating factor in determining what, if any, administrative action will be imposed. some of the mitigating factors the directorate of defense trade controls may consider are i whether the transaction would have been authorized, and under what conditions, had a proper license request been made ii why the violation occurred iii the degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation iv whether the person has instituted or improved an internal compliance program to reduce the likelihood of future violation v whether the person making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the person s senior management. if not, then the directorate will not deem the disclosure voluntary as covered in this section. 4 the provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter. 5 nothing in this section shall be interpreted to negate or lessen the affirmative duty pursuant to 126.1 e , 126.16 h 5 , and 126.17 h 5 of this subchapter upon persons to inform the directorate of defense trade controls of the actual or final sale, export, transfer, reexport, or retransfer of a defense article, technical data, or defense service to any country referred to in 126.1 of this subchapter, any citizen of such country, or any person acting on its behalf. c notification. 1 any person wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify the directorate of defense trade controls immediately after a violation is discovered and then conduct a thorough review of all defense trade transactions where a violation is suspected. i if the notification does not contain all the information required by paragraph c 2 of this section, a full disclosure must be submitted within 60 calendar days of the notification, or the directorate of defense trade controls will not deem the notification to qualify as a voluntary disclosure. ii if the person is unable to provide a full disclosure within the 60 calendar day deadline, an empowered official see 120.67 of this subchapter or a senior officer may request an extension of time in writing. a request for an extension must specify what information required by paragraph c 2 of this section could not be immediately provided and the reasons why. iii before approving an extension of time to provide the full disclosure, the directorate of defense trade controls may require the requester to certify in writing that they will provide the full disclosure within a specific time period. iv failure to provide a full disclosure within a reasonable time may result in a decision by the directorate of defense trade controls not to consider the notification as a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate disposition of the violation. in addition, the directorate of defense trade controls may direct the requester to furnish all relevant information surrounding the violation. 2 notification of a violation must be in writing and should include the following information i a precise description of the nature and extent of the violation e.g., an unauthorized shipment, doing business with a party denied u.s. export privileges, etc. ii the exact circumstances surrounding the violation a thorough explanation of why, when, where, and how the violation occurred iii the complete identities and addresses of all persons known or suspected to be involved in the activities giving rise to the violation including mailing, shipping, and e-mail addresses telephone and fax facsimile numbers and any other known identifying information iv department of state license numbers, exemption citation, or description of any other authorization, if applicable v u.s. munitions list category and subcategory, product description, quantity, and characteristics or technological capability of the hardware, technical data or defense service involved vi a description of corrective actions already undertaken that clearly identifies the new compliance initiatives implemented to address the causes of the violations set forth in the voluntary disclosure and any internal disciplinary action taken and how these corrective actions are designed to deter those particular violations from occurring again vii the name and address of the person making the disclosure and a point of contact, if different, should further information be needed. 3 factors to be addressed in the voluntary disclosure include, for example, whether the violation was intentional or inadvertent the degree to which the person responsible for the violation was familiar with the laws and regulations, and whether the person was the subject of prior administrative or criminal action under the aeca whether the violations are systemic and the details of compliance measures, processes and programs, including training, that were in place to prevent such violations, if any. in addition to immediately providing written notification, persons are strongly urged to conduct a thorough review of all export-related transactions where a possible violation is suspected. d documentation. the written disclosure should be accompanied by copies of substantiating documents. where appropriate, the documentation should include, but not be limited to 1 licensing documents e.g., license applications, export licenses, and end-user statements , exemption citation, or other authorization description, if any 2 shipping documents e.g., electronic export information filing, including the internal transaction number, air waybills, and bills of laden, invoices, and any other associated documents and 3 any other relevant documents must be retained by the person making the disclosure until the directorate of defense trade controls requests them or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been made. e certification. a certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person s knowledge and belief. certifications should be executed by an empowered official see 120.67 of this subchapter , or by a senior officer e.g. chief executive officer, president, vice-president, comptroller, treasurer, general counsel, or member of the board of directors . if the violation is a major violation, reveals a systemic pattern of violations, or reflects the absence of an effective compliance program, the directorate of defense trade controls may require that such certification be made by a senior officer of the company. f oral presentations. oral presentation is generally not necessary to augment the written presentation. however, if the person making the disclosure believes a meeting is desirable, a request should be included with the written presentation. g

730.2,"the ear have been designed primarily to implement the export administration act of 1979, as amended, 50 u.s.c. app. 2401 2420 eaa . there are numerous other legal authorities underlying the ear. these are listed in the"
730.3,"the term dual use is often used to describe the types of items subject to the ear. a dual-use item is one that has civil applications as well as terrorism and military or weapons of mass destruction wmd -related applications. the precise description of what is subject to the ear is in 734.3, which does not limit the ear to controlling only dual-use items. in essence, the ear control any item warranting control that is not exclusively controlled for export, reexport, or transfer in-country by another agency of the u.s. government or otherwise excluded from being subject to the ear pursuant to 734.3 b of the ear. thus, items subject to the ear include purely civilian items, items with both civil and military, terrorism or potential wmd-related applications, and items that are exclusively used for military applications but that do not warrant control under the international traffic in arms regulations itar 22 cfr parts 120 et seq. ."
730.4,"in addition to the departments and agencies mentioned in 730.3 of this part, other departments and agencies have jurisdiction over certain narrower classes of exports and reexports. these include the department of treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac , which administers controls against certain countries that are the object of sanctions affecting not only exports and reexports, but also imports and financial dealings. for your convenience, supplement no. 3 to part 730 identifies other departments and agencies with regulatory jurisdiction over certain types of exports and reexports. this is not a comprehensive list, and the brief descriptions are only generally indicative of the types of controls administered and or enforced by each agency."
730.5,"the core of the export control provisions of the ear concerns exports from the united states. you will find, however, that some provisions give broad meaning to the term export , apply to transactions outside of the united states, or apply to activities other than exports. a reexports. commodities, software, and technology that have been exported from the united states are generally subject to the ear with respect to reexport. many such reexports, however, may go to many destinations without a license or will qualify for an exception from licensing requirements. b foreign products. in some cases, exports from abroad, reexports or transfers in-country of items produced outside of the united states are subject to the ear when they contain more than the de minimis amount of controlled u.s.-origin content as specified in 734.4 of the ear or when they are the direct product of specified technology, software, or a plant or major component of a plant as specified in 736.2 b 3 of the ear. c scope of exports . certain actions that you might not regard as an export in other contexts do constitute an export subject to the ear. the release of technology to a foreign national in the united states through such means as demonstration or oral briefing is deemed an export. other examples of exports under the ear include the return of foreign equipment to its country of origin after repair in the united states, shipments from a u.s. foreign trade zone, and the electronic transmission of non-public data that will be received abroad. d u.s. person activities. the ear restrict specific activities of u.s. persons, wherever located, related to the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices, missiles, chemical or biological weapons, whole plants for chemical weapons precursors, and certain military-intelligence end uses and end users, as described in 744.6 of the ear."
730.6,"the export control provisions of the ear are intended to serve the national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other interests of the united states, which in many cases are reflected in international obligations or arrangements. some controls are designed to restrict access to items subject to the ear by countries or persons that might apply such items to uses inimical to u.s. interests. these include controls designed to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and controls designed to limit the military and terrorism support capability of certain countries. the effectiveness of many of the controls under the ear is enhanced by their being maintained as part of multilateral control arrangements. multilateral export control cooperation is sought through arrangements such as the nuclear suppliers group, the australia group, and the missile technology control regime. the ear also include some export controls to protect the united states from the adverse impact of the unrestricted export of commodities in short supply."
730.7,"a relatively small percentage of exports and reexports subject to the ear require an application to bis for a license. many items are not on the commerce control list ccl supplement no. 1 to 774.1 of the ear , or, if on the ccl, require a license to only a limited number of countries. other transactions may be covered by one or more of the license exceptions in the ear. in such cases no application need be made to bis."
730.8,"a how the ear are organized. the export administration regulations ear are structured in a logical manner. in dealing with the ear you may find it helpful to be aware of the overall organization of these regulations. in order to determine what the rules are and what you need to do, review the titles and the introductory sections of the parts of the ear. 1 how do you go about determining your obligations under the ear part 732 of the ear provides steps you may follow to determine your obligations under the ear. you will find guidance to enable you to tell whether or not your transaction is subject to the ear and, if it is, whether it qualifies for a license exception or must be authorized through issuance of a license. 2 are your items or activities subject to the ear at all part 734 of the ear defines the items and activities that are subject to the ear. note that the definition of items subject to the ear includes, but is not limited to, items listed on the commerce control list in part 774 of the ear. 3 if subject to the ear, what do the ear require part 736 of the ear lists all the prohibitions that are contained in the ear. note that certain prohibitions general prohibitions one through three apply to items as indicated on the ccl, and others general prohibitions four through ten prohibit certain activities and apply to all items subject to the ear unless otherwise indicated. 4 do you need a license for your item or activity what policies will bis apply if you do need to submit license application the ear have four principal ways of describing license requirements i the ear may require a license to a country if your item is listed on the ccl and the country chart in part 738 of the ear tells that a license is required to that country. virtually all export control classification numbers eccn on the ccl are covered by the country chart in part 738 of the ear. that part identifies the limited number of entries that are not included on the chart. these eccns will state the specific countries that require a license or refer you to a self-contained section, i.e., short supply in part 754 of the ear, or embargoes in part 746 of the ear. if a license is required, you should consult part 740 of the ear which describes the license exception that may be available for items on the ccl. part 742 of the ear describes the licensing policies that bis will apply in reviewing an application you file. note that part 754 of the ear on short supply controls and part 746 on embargoes are self-contained parts that include the available exceptions and licensing policy. ii a license requirement may be based on the end-use or end-user in a transaction, primarily for proliferation reasons. part 744 of the ear describes such requirements and relevant licensing policies and includes both restrictions on items and restrictions on the activities of u.s. persons. iii a license is required for virtually all exports to embargoed destinations, such as cuba. part 746 of the ear describes all the licensing requirements, license review policies and license exceptions that apply to such destinations. if your transaction involves one of these countries, you should first look at this part. this part also describes controls that may be maintained under the ear to implement un sanctions. iv in addition, under 736.2 b 9 and 10 of the ear, you may not engage in a transaction knowing a violation is about to occur or violate any orders, terms, and conditions under the ear. part 764 of the ear describes prohibited transactions with a person denied export privileges or activity that violates the terms or conditions of a denial order. 5 how do you file a license application and what will happen to the application once you do file it what if you need authorization for multiple transactions parts 748 and 750 of the ear provide information on license submission and processing. if your application is denied, part 756 of the ear provides rules for filing appeals. 6 how do you clear shipments with the u.s. customs service part 758 of the ear describes the requirements for clearance of exports. 7 where do you find the rules on restrictive trade practices and boycotts part 760 of the ear deals with restrictive trade practices and boycotts. 8 where are the rules on recordkeeping and enforcement part 762 of the ear sets out your recordkeeping requirements, and parts 764 and 766 of the ear deal with violations and enforcement proceedings. 9 what is the effect of foreign availability part 768 of the ear provides rules for determining foreign availability of items subject to controls. 10 do the ear provide definitions and interpretations part 770 of the ear contains interpretations and part 772 of the ear lists definitions used. b why the ear are so detailed. some people will find the great length of the ear and their extensive use of technical terms intimidating. bis believes, however, that such detail and precision can and does serve the interests of the public. the detailed listing of technical parameters in the ccl establishes precise, objective criteria. this should, in most cases, enable you to ascertain the appropriate control status. broader, more subjective criteria would leave exporters and reexporters more dependent upon interpretations and rulings by bis officials. moreover, much of the detail in the ccl is derived from multilaterally adopted lists, and the specificity serves to enhance the uniformity and effectiveness of international control practices and to promote a level playing field . the detailed presentation of such elements as licensing and export clearance procedures enables you to find in one place what you need to know to comply with pertinent requirements. of special importance is the detailed listing of license exception criteria, as these will enable you to determine quickly, and with confidence, that you may proceed with a transaction without delay. finally, some of the detail results from the need to draft the ear with care in order to avoid loop-holes and to permit effective enforcement. c where to get help. throughout the ear you will find information on offices you can contact for various purposes and types of information. general information including assistance in understanding the ear, information on how to obtain forms, electronic services, publications, and information on training programs offered by bis, is available from the office of export services at the following locations outreach and educational

732.1,"a 1 introduction. in this part, references to the ear are references to 15 cfr chapter vii, subchapter c. this part is intended to help you determine your obligations under the ear by listing logical steps in 732.2 through 732.5 of this part that you can take in reviewing these regulations. a flow chart describing these steps is contained in supplement no. 1 to part 732. by cross-references to the relevant provisions of the ear, this part describes the suggested steps for you to determine applicability of the following i the scope of the ear part 734 of the ear ii each of the general prohibitions part 736 of the ear iii the license exceptions part 740 of the ear and iv other requirements such as clearing your export with the u.s. customs service, keeping records, and completing and documenting license applications. 2 these steps describe the organization of the ear, the relationship among the provisions of the ear, and the appropriate order for you to consider the various provisions of the ear. 3 the general information in this part is intended to provide an overview of the steps to be taken for certain requirements in the ear, though not all of them. nothing in this part shall be construed as altering or affecting any other authority, regulation, investigation or other enforcement measure provided by or established under any other provision of federal law, including provisions of the ear. b facts about your transaction. the following five types of facts determine your obligations under the ear and will be of help to you in reviewing these steps 1 what is it what an item is, for export control purposes, depends on its classification, which is its place on the commerce control list see part 774 of the ear . 2 where is it going the country of ultimate destination for an export or reexport also determines licensing requirements see parts 738 and 774 of the ear concerning the country chart and the commerce control list . 3 who will receive it the ultimate end-user of your item cannot be a bad end-user. see general prohibition four denial orders in 736.2 b 4 and parts 744 and 764 of the ear for a reference to the list of persons you may not deal with. 4 what will they do with it the ultimate end-use of your item cannot be a bad end-use. see general prohibition five end-use end-user in 736.2 b 5 and part 744 of the ear for general end-use and end-user restrictions. 5 what else do they do conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project as described in 744.6 of the ear may prevent you from dealing with someone. c are your items and activities subject to the ear you should first determine whether your commodity, software, or technology is subject to the ear see part 734 of the ear concerning scope , and steps 1 through 6 help you do that. for exports from the united states, only steps 1 and 2 are relevant. if you already know that your item or activity is subject to the ear, you should go on to consider the ten general prohibitions in part 736 of the ear. if your item or activity is not subject to the ear, you have no obligations under the ear and may skip the remaining steps. d does your item or activity require a license under one or more of the ten general prohibitions 1 brief summary of the ten general prohibitions. the general prohibitions are found in part 736 of the ear and referred to in these steps. they consist, very briefly, of the following i general prohibition one exports and reexports export and reexport of controlled items to listed countries. ii general prohibition two parts and components reexports reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of controlled u.s. content. iii general prohibition three foreign-produced direct product reexports reexport and export from abroad of the foreign-produced direct product of u.s. technology and software. iv general prohibition four denial orders engaging in actions prohibited by a denial order. v general prohibition five end-use end-user export or reexport to prohibited end uses or end users. vi general prohibition six embargo export or reexport to embargoed destinations. vii general prohibition seven u.s. person proliferation activity support of proliferation activities. viii general prohibition eight in-transit in-transit shipments and items to be unladen from vessels and aircraft. ix general prohibition nine orders, terms and conditions violation of any orders, terms, or conditions. x general prohibition ten knowledge violation to occur proceeding with transactions with knowledge that a violation has occurred or is about to occur. 2 controls on items on the commerce control list ccl . if your item or activity is subject to the ear, you should determine whether any one or more of the ten general prohibitions require a license for your export, reexport, or activity. steps 7 through 11 refer to classification of your item on the commerce control list ccl part 774 of the ear and how to use the country chart supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the ear to determine whether a license is required based upon the classification of your item. these steps refer to general prohibitions one exports and reexports , two parts and components reexports , and three foreign-produced direct product reexports for all countries except cuba, iran, north korea, and syria. for these countries, you may skip steps 7 through 11 and go directly to step 12. 3 controls on activities. steps 12 through 18 refer to general prohibitions four through ten. those general prohibitions apply to all items subject to the ear, not merely those items listed on the ccl in part 774 of the ear. for example, they refer to the general prohibitions for persons denied export privileges, prohibited end-uses and end-users, countries subject to a comprehensive embargo e.g., cuba, iran, north korea and syria , prohibited activities of u.s. persons in support of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, prohibited unlading of shipments, compliance with orders, terms and conditions, and activities when a violation has occurred or is about to occur. 4 general prohibitions. if none of the ten general prohibitions applies, you should skip the steps concerning license exceptions and for exports from the united states, review steps 27 through 29 concerning shipper s export declarations to be filed with the u.s. customs service, destination control statements for export control documents, and recordkeeping requirements. e is a license exception available to overcome the license requirement if you decide by reviewing the ccl in combination with the country chart that a license is required for your destination, you should determine whether a license exception will except you from that requirement. steps 20 through 24 help you determine whether a license exception is available. note that generally license exceptions are not available to overcome general prohibitions four through ten. however, selected license exceptions for embargoed destinations are specified in part 746 of the ear and license exceptions for short supply controls are specified in part 754 of the ear. if a license exception is available and the export is from the united states, you should review steps 26 through 28 concerning shipper s export declarations to be filed with the u.s. customs service, destination control statements for export control documents and recordkeeping requirements. if a license exception is not available, go on to steps 25 through 29. f how do you apply for a license if you must file a license application, you should review the requirements of part 748 of the ear as suggested by step 26. then you should review steps 27 through 29 concerning shipper s export declarations to be filed with the u.s. customs service, destination control statements for export control documents, and recordkeeping requirements."
732.2,"steps 1 though 6 are designed to aid you in determining the scope of the ear. a flow chart describing these steps is contained in supplement no. 2 to part 732. a step 1 items subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another federal agency. this step is relevant for both exports and reexports. determine whether your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another federal agency as provided in 734.3 of the ear. 1 if your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another federal agency, comply with the regulations of that agency. you need not comply with the ear and may skip the remaining steps. 2 if your item is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another federal agency, then proceed to step 2 in paragraph b of this section. b step 2 publicly available technology and software. this step is relevant for both exports and reexports. determine if your technology or software is publicly available as defined and explained at part 734 of the ear. supplement no. 1 to part 734 of the ear contains several practical examples describing publicly available technology and software that are outside the scope of the ear. the examples are illustrative, not comprehensive. note that encryption software classified under eccn 5d002 on the commerce control list refer to supplement no.1 to part 774 of the ear is subject to the ear even if publicly available, except for publicly available encryption object code software classified under eccn 5d002 when the corresponding source code meets the criteria specified in 740.13 e of the ear. the following also remains subject to the ear software or technology for the production of a firearm, or firearm frame or receiver, controlled under eccn 0a501, as referenced in 734.7 c of the ear . 1 if your technology or software is publicly available, and therefore outside the scope of the ear, you may proceed with the export or reexport if you are not a u.s. person subject to general prohibition seven. if you are a u.s. person, go to step 15 at 732.3 j of this part. if you are a u.s. person and general prohibition seven concerning proliferation activity of u.s. persons does not apply, then you may proceed with the export or reexport of your publicly available technology or software. note that all u.s. persons are subject to the provisions of general prohibition seven. 2 if your technology or software is not publicly available and you are exporting from the united states, skip to the step 7 in 732.3 b of this part concerning the general prohibitions. 3 if you are exporting items from a foreign country, you should then proceed to step 3 in paragraph c of this section and the other steps concerning the scope of the ear. c step 3 reexport of u.s.-origin items. this step is appropriate only for reexporters. for an item in a foreign country, you should determine whether the item is of u.s. origin. if it is of u.s.-origin, skip to step 7 in 732.3 b of this part. if it is not of u.s. origin, then proceed to step 4 in paragraph d of this section. d step 4 foreign-made items incorporating controlled u.s.-origin items. this step is appropriate only for items that are made outside the united states and not currently located in the united states. special requirements and restrictions apply to foreign-made items that incorporate u.s.-origin encryption items see 734.4 a 2 , b , and g of the ear . 1 determining whether your foreign made item is subject to the ear. using the guidance provided in supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the ear, determine whether controlled u.s.-origin items are incorporated into the foreign-made item and are above the de minimis level set forth in 734.4 of the ear. 2 if no u.s.-origin controlled items are incorporated or if the percentage of incorporated u.s.-origin controlled items are equal to or below the de minimis level described in 734.4 of the ear, then the foreign-made item is not subject to the ear by reason of the de minimis rules, and you should go on to consider step 6 regarding the foreign-produced direct product rule. 3 if the foreign-made item incorporates more than the de minimis level of u.s.-origin items, then that item is subject to the ear and you should skip to step 7 at 732.3 of this part and consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements to determine applicability of these provisions to the foreign-made item. e reserved f step 6 direct product rule. foreign items that are the direct product of u.s. technology, software, or plant or major component of a plant made from u.s. technology or software may be subject to the ear if they meet the conditions of general prohibition three in 736.2 b 3 of the ear. direct products that are subject to the ear may require a license to be exported from abroad or reexported to certain countries. 1 subject to the ear. if your foreign item is captured by the direct product rule general prohibition three , then the item is subject to the ear and its export from abroad or reexport may require a license. you should next consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements. if the item is not captured by general prohibition three, then you have completed the steps necessary to determine whether the item is subject to the ear, and you may skip the remaining steps. as described in part 734 of the ear, items outside the u.s. are subject to the ear when they are i u.s.-origin commodities, software, or technology, unless controlled for export exclusively by another u.s. federal agency or unless publicly available ii foreign-origin commodities, software, or technology that are within the scope of general prohibition two de minimis rules , or general prohibition three direct product rule . however, such foreign-origin items are also outside the scope of the ear if they are controlled for export exclusively by another u.s. federal agency or, if technology or software, are publicly available as described in paragraph b of this section. 2 reserved"
732.3,"a introduction. if your item or activity is subject to the scope of the ear, you should then consider each of the ten general prohibitions listed in part 736 of the ear. general prohibitions one exports and reexports , two parts and components reexports , and three foreign-produced direct product reexports 736.2 b 1 , 2 , and 3 of the ear are product controls that are shaped and limited by parameters specified on the ccl and country chart. general prohibitions four through ten are prohibitions on certain activities that are not allowed without authorization from bis, and these prohibitions apply to all items subject to the ear unless otherwise specified 736.2 b 4 through 10 of the ear . b step 7 classification. 1 you should classify your items subject to the ear in the relevant entry on the ccl, and you may do so on your own without bis assistance. the ccl includes a supplement no. 4 to part 774 commerce control list order of review. this supplement establishes the steps i.e., the order of review that should be followed in classifying items that are subject to the ear. the exporter, reexporter, or transferor is responsible for correctly classifying the items in a transaction, which may involve submitting a classification request to bis. failure to classify or have classified the item correctly does not relieve the person of the obligation to obtain a license when one is required by the ear. 2 you have a right to request the applicable classification of your item from bis, and bis has a duty to provide that classification to you. for further information on how to obtain classification assistance from bis, see part 748 of the ear. 3 for items subject to the ear but not listed on the ccl, the proper classification is ear99. this number is a basket for items not specified under any ccl entry and appears at the end of each category on the ccl. 4 items subject to temporary ccl controls are classified under the eccn 0y521 series i.e., 0a521, 0b521, 0c521, 0d521 and 0e521 pursuant to 742.6 a 8 of the ear while a determination is being made as to whether classification under a revised or new eccn or ear99 designation is appropriate. c step 8 country of ultimate destination. you should determine the country of ultimate destination. the country of destination determines the applicability of several general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements. note that part 754 of the ear concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the only location in the ear that contains both the prohibitions and exceptions applicable to short supply controls. d step 9 reason for control and the country chart 1 reason for control and column identifier within the export control classification number eccn . once you have determined that your item is controlled by a specific eccn, you must use information contained in the license requirements section of that eccn in combination with the country chart to decide whether a license is required under general prohibitions one, two, or three to a particular destination. the ccl and the country chart are taken together to define these license requirements. the applicable eccn will indicate the reason or reasons for control for items within that eccn. for example, eccn 6a007 is controlled for national security, missile technology, and anti-terrorism reasons. 2 reason for control within the country chart. with each of the applicable country chart column identifiers noted in the correct eccn, turn to the country chart. locate the correct country chart column identifier on the horizontal axis, and determine whether an x is marked in the cell next to the destination in question. consult 738.4 of the ear for comprehensive instructions on using the country chart and a detailed example. i an x in the cell or cells for the relevant country and reason s for control column indicates that a license is required for general prohibitions one exports and reexports in the form received , two parts and components reexports , and three foreign-produced direct product reexports . see 736.2 b 1 , b 2 , and b 3 of the ear . ii if one or more cells have an x in the relevant column, a license is required unless you qualify for a license exception described in part 740 of the ear. if a cell does not contain an x for your destination in one or more relevant columns, a license is not required under the ccl and the country chart. iii additional controls may apply to your export. you must go on to steps 12 through 18 described in paragraphs g to m of this section to determine whether additional limits described in general prohibition two parts and components reexports and general prohibition three foreign-produced direct product reexports apply to your proposed transaction. if you are exporting an item from the united states, you should skip step 10 and step 11. proceed directly to step 12 in paragraph g of this section. 3 license requirements not on the country chart. there are two instances where the country chart cannot be used to determine if a license is required. items controlled for short supply reasons are not governed by the country chart. part 754 of the ear contains license requirements and license exceptions for items subject to short supply controls. a limited number of eccns contained on the ccl do not identify a country chart column identifier. in these instances, the eccn states whether a license is required and for which destinations. see 738.3 a of the ear for a list of the eccns for which you do not need to consult the country chart to determine licensing requirements. 4 destinations subject to embargo and other special controls provisions. the country chart does not apply to cuba, iran, north korea, and syria. for those countries you should review the provisions at part 746 of the ear and may skip this step concerning the country chart. for iraq and russia, the country chart provides for certain license requirements, and part 746 of the ear provides additional requirements. 5 items subject to the ear but not on the ccl. items subject to the ear that are not on the ccl are properly classified ear99. for such items, you may skip this step and proceed directly with step 12 in paragraph g of this section. e step 10 foreign-made items incorporating controlled u.s.-origin items and the de minimis rules 1 de minimis rules. if your foreign-made item abroad is a foreign-made commodity that incorporates controlled u.s.-origin commodities, a foreign-made commodity that is bundled with controlled u.s.-origin software, foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled u.s.-origin software, or foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled u.s.-origin technology, then it is subject to the ear if the u.s.-origin controlled content exceeds the de minimis levels described in sec. 734.4 of the ear. 2 guidance for calculations. for guidance on how to calculate the u.s.-controlled content, refer to supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the ear. note, u.s.-origin technology controlled by eccn 9e003.a.1 through a.11, and .h, and related controls, and encryption software controlled for ei reasons under eccn 5d002 not eligible for de minimis treatment pursuant to 734.4 b of the ear or encryption technology controlled for ei reasons under eccn 5e002 not eligible for de minimis treatment pursuant to 734.4 a 2 of the ear do not lose their u.s.-origin when redrawn, used, consulted, or otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other software or technology of any other origin. therefore, any subsequent or similar software or technology prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is based on or uses any such u.s.-origin software or technology is subject to the ear. f step 11 foreign-produced direct product rule general prohibition three. foreign-produced items located outside the u.s. that are the direct product of technology or software subject to the ear or produced by a plant or major component of a plant located outside the united states that is a direct product of u.s.-origin technology or software subject to the ear, whether made in the u.s. or a foreign country, may be subject to the ear if they meet the conditions of general prohibition three in 736.2 b 3 . direct products that are subject to the ear may require a license to be exported from abroad, transferred in-country , or reexported to specified countries or end users. if your foreign item meets the conditions of the foreign-produced direct product rule general prohibition three , then your export from abroad, transfer in-country , or reexport is subject to the ear. you should next consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements. if your item does not meet the conditions of general prohibition three, then your export from abroad, transfer in-country , or reexport is not subject to the ear. you have completed the steps necessary to determine whether your transaction is subject to the ear, and you may skip the remaining steps. g step 12 persons denied export privileges. 1 determine whether your transferee, ultimate end-user, any intermediate consignee, or any other party to a transaction is a person denied export privileges see part 764 of the ear . it is a violation of the ear to engage in any activity that violates the terms or conditions of a denial order. general prohibition four denial orders applies to all items subject to the ear, i.e., both items on the ccl and within ear99. 2 there are no license exceptions to general prohibition four denial orders . the prohibition concerning persons denied export privileges may be overcome only by a specific authorization from bis, something that is rarely granted. h step 13 prohibited end-uses and end-users. 1 review the end-uses and end-users prohibited under general prohibition five end-use and end-user 736.2 b 5 of the ear described in part 744 of the ear. part 744 of the ear contains all the end-use and end-user license requirements, and those are in addition to the license requirements under general prohibitions one exports and reexports , two parts and components reexports , and three foreign-produced direct product reexports . unless otherwise indicated, the license requirements of general prohibition five end-use and end-user described in part 744 of the ear apply to all items subject to the ear, i.e. both items on the ccl and within ear99. moreover, the requirements of general prohibition five end-use and end-user are in addition to various end-use and end-user limitations placed on certain license exceptions. 2 under license exception tsu 740.13 of the ear , operation technology and software, sales technology, and software updates overcome general prohibition five end-use and end-user 736.2 b 5 of the ear if all terms and conditions of these provisions are met by the exporter or reexporter. i step 14 embargoed countries and special destinations. if your destination for any item is cuba, iran, iraq, north korea, or syria, you must consider the requirements of parts 742 and 746 of the ear. unless otherwise indicated, general prohibition six embargo applies to all items subject to the ear, i.e., both items on the ccl and within ear99. see 746.1 b for destinations subject to limited sanctions under united nations security council arms embargoes. see 746.5 for russian and belarusian industry sector sanctions, 746.6 for crimea region of ukraine and covered regions of ukraine, 746.8 for sanctions against russia and belarus, and 746.10 for `luxury goods sanctions against russia and belarus and russian and belarusian oligarchs and malign actors. you may not make an export, reexport, or transfer in-country contrary to the provisions of part 746 of the ear without a license unless 1 you are exporting, reexporting, or transferring only published information or software as specified in 734.7 or other items outside the scope of the ear, or 2 you qualify for a license exception referenced in part 746 of the ear concerning embargoed destinations. you may not use a license exception described in part 740 of the ear to overcome general prohibition six embargo 736.2 b 6 of the ear unless it is specifically authorized in part 746 of the ear. note that part 754 of the ear concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the only location in the ear for both the prohibitions and exceptions applicable to short supply controls. j step 15 restrictions on specific activities of u.s. persons. 1 review the scope of activity prohibited by general prohibition seven u.s. person activities 736.2 b 7 of the ear as that activity is described in 744.6 of the ear. keep in mind that such activity is not limited to exports, reexports, or transfers in-country . u.s. person activities extend to services and shipping or transmitting certain wholly foreign-origin items, or facilitating such shipments or transmissions, in support of the specified weapons of mass destruction and military-intelligence-related end uses and end users and is not limited to items listed on the ccl or designated ear99. see 744.6 b 6 of the ear for the full definition of support, which includes ordering, storing, using, selling, loaning, disposing, servicing, financing, transporting, freight forwarding, or conducting negotiations in furtherance of. 2 review the definition of u.s. person in 772.1 of the ear. k step 16 in-transit. shippers and operators of vessels or aircraft should review general prohibition eight in-transit to determine the countries in which you may not unladen or ship certain items in-transit. general prohibition eight applies to all items subject to the ear, i.e. both items on the ccl and within ear99. l step 17 review orders, terms, and conditions. review the orders, terms, and conditions applicable to your transaction. general prohibition nine orders, terms, and conditions prohibits the violation of any orders, terms, and conditions imposed under the ear. terms and conditions are frequently contained in licenses. in addition, the ten general prohibitions part 736 of the ear and the license exceptions part 740 of the ear impose terms and conditions or limitations on your proposed transactions and use of license exceptions. a given license or license exception may not be used unless each relevant term or condition is met. m step 18 review the know your customer guidance and general prohibition ten knowledge violation to occur . license requirements under the ear are determined solely by the classification, end-use, end-user, ultimate destination, and conduct of u.s. persons. supplement no. 1 to part 732 of the ear is intended to provide helpful guidance regarding the process for the evaluation of information about customers, end-uses, and end-users. general prohibition ten knowledge violation to occur prohibits anyone from proceeding with a transaction with knowledge that a violation of the ear has occurred or is about to occur. it also prohibits related shipping, financing, and other services. general prohibition ten applies to all items subject to the ear, i.e. both items on the ccl and within ear99. n step 19 complete the review of the general prohibitions. after completion of steps described in this section and review of all ten general prohibitions in part 736 of the ear, including cross-referenced regulations in the ear, you will know which, if any, of the ten general prohibitions of the ear apply to you and your contemplated transaction or activity. 1 if none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your export from the united states, no license from bis is required, you do not need to qualify for a license exception under part 740 of the ear. you should skip the steps in 732.4 of this part regarding license exceptions and proceed directly to the steps in 732.5 of this part regarding recordkeeping, clearing the bureau of customs and border protection with the appropriate shipper s export declaration or automated export system record, and using the required destination control statement. 2 if none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your reexport or export from abroad, no license is required and you should skip all remaining steps. 3 if one or more of the ten general prohibitions are applicable, continue with the remaining steps."
732.4,"a introduction to steps for license exceptions. if your export or reexport is subject to the ear and is subject to general prohibitions one exports and reexports , two parts and components reexports , or three foreign-produced direct product reexports , consider the steps listed in paragraph b of this section. if your export or reexport is subject to general prohibitions four denial orders , seven u.s. person proliferation activity , eight in-transit , nine orders, terms, and conditions , or ten knowledge violation to occur , there are no license exceptions available for your export or reexport. if your export is subject to general prohibition five end-use end-user , consult part 744 of the ear. if your export or reexport is subject to general prohibition six embargo , consult part 746 of the ear for applicable license exceptions. b steps for license exceptions 1 step 20 applicability of general prohibitions. determine whether any one or more of the general prohibitions described in 736.2 b of the ear apply to your export or reexport. if no general prohibition applies to your export or reexport, then you may proceed with your export or reexport and need not review part 740 of the ear regarding license exceptions. you are reminded of your recordkeeping obligations related to the clearance of the u.s. customs service provided in parts 762 and 758 of the ear. 2 step 21 applicability of restrictions on all license exceptions. determine whether any one or more of the restrictions in 740.2 of the ear applies to your export or reexport. if any one or more of these restrictions apply, there are no license exceptions available to you, and you must either obtain a license or refrain from the export or reexport. 3 step 22 terms and conditions of the license exceptions. i if none of the restrictions in 740.2 of the ear applies, then review each of the license exceptions to determine whether any one of them authorizes your export or reexport. eligibility for license exceptions is based on the item, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use, and the end-user, along with any special conditions imposed within a specific license exception. ii you may meet the conditions for more than one license exception. moreover, although you may not qualify for some license exceptions you may qualify for others. review the broadest license exceptions first, and use any license exception available to you. you are not required to use the most restrictive applicable license exception. if you fail to qualify for the license exception that you first consider, you may consider any other license exception until you have determined that no license exception is available. iii license exceptions tmp, rpl, bag, avs, gov, and

minimis amount of controlled u.s. content, as defined in 734.4 of the ear concerning the scope of the ear. a it incorporates more than the de minimis amount of controlled u.s. content, as defined in 734.4 of the ear concerning the scope of the ear b it is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable eccn and c its export to the country of destination requires a license for that control reason as indicated on the country chart. the scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is reflected on the country chart. ii each license exception described in part 740 of the ear supersedes general prohibition two if all terms and conditions of a given license exception are met by the exporter or reexporter. 3 general prohibition three foreign-direct product fdp rules. i you may not, without a license or license exception, export from abroad, reexport, or transfer in-country

region of ukraine and covered regions of ukraine that is embargoed by the united states or otherwise made subject to controls under part 734 as both are described at part 746 of the ear. each section in part 746 specifies whether the license requirements extend to exports, reexports, and transfers in-country . ii license exceptions to general prohibition six are described in part 746 of the ear, on embargoes and other special controls. unless a license exception or other authorization is authorized in part 746 of the ear, the license exceptions described in part 740 of the ear are not available to overcome this general prohibition. 7 general prohibition seven support of proliferation activities and certain military-intelligence end uses and end users u.s. person activities . i

revocation of that license or exception. there are no license exceptions to this general prohibition ten in part 740 of the ear."
736.2(b),"general prohibitions. the following ten general prohibitions describe certain exports, reexports, transfers in-country , and other conduct, subject to the scope of the ear, in which you may not engage unless you either have a license from the bureau of industry and security bis or qualify under part 740 of the ear for a license exception from each applicable general prohibition in this paragraph. the license exceptions at part 740 of the ear apply only to general prohibitions one exports and reexports in the form received , two parts and components reexports , and three foreign-produced direct product reexports however, selected license exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the ear concerning embargo destinations and in 744.2 c of the ear regarding nuclear end-uses and in 744.11 and in supplement no. 4 to part 744 entity list. 1 general prohibition one export and reexport of controlled items to listed countries exports and reexports . you may not, without a license or license exception, export any item subject to the ear to another country or reexport any item of u.s.-origin if each of the following is true i the item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable export control classification number eccn , and ii export to the country of destination requires a license for the control reason as indicated on the country chart at part 738 of the ear. the scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your item and the ultimate destination as that combination is reflected on the country chart. 2 general prohibition two reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of controlled u.s. content u.s. content reexports . i you may not, without a license or license exception, reexport or export from abroad foreign-made commodities that incorporate controlled u.s.-origin commodities, foreign-made commodities that are bundled with controlled u.s.-origin software, foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled u.s.-origin software, or foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled u.s.-origin technology if such items require a license according to any of the provisions in the ear and incorporate or are commingled with more than a de minimis amount of controlled u.s. content, as defined in 734.4 of the ear concerning the scope of the ear. a it incorporates more than the de minimis amount of controlled u.s. content, as defined in 734.4 of the ear concerning the scope of the ear b it is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable eccn"
738.1,"a commerce control list scope. 1 in this part, references to the ear are references to 15 cfr chapter vii, subchapter c. the bureau of industry and security bis maintains the commerce control list ccl within the export administration regulations ear , which includes items i.e., commodities, software, and technology subject to the export licensing authority of bis. the ccl does not include those items exclusively controlled for export or reexport by another department or agency of the u.s. government. in instances where agencies other than the department of commerce administer controls over related items, entries in the ccl contain a reference to these controls. 2 the ccl is contained in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the ear. supplement no. 2 to part 774 of the ear contains the general technology and software notes relevant to entries contained in the ccl. 3 items that warrant control for export or reexport but currently are not permanently classified on the ccl. items subject to temporary ccl controls are classified under the eccn 0y521 series i.e., 0a521, 0b521, 0c521, 0d521, and 0e521 pursuant to 742.6 a 8 of the ear while a determination is made as to whether classification under a revised or new eccn, or an ear99 designation, is appropriate. b commerce country chart scope. bis also maintains the commerce country chart. the commerce country chart, located in supplement no. 1 to part 738, contains licensing requirements based on destination and reason for control. in combination with the ccl, the commerce country chart allows you to determine whether a license is required for items on the ccl to any country in the world."
738.2,"a categories. the ccl is divided into 10 categories, numbered as follows b groups. within each category, items are arranged by group. each category contains the same five groups. each group is identified by the letters a through e, as follows c order of review. the ccl includes a supplement no. 4 to part 774 commerce control list order of review. this supplement establishes the steps i.e., the order of review that should be followed in classifying items that are subject to the ear. d entries 1 composition of an entry. within each group, individual items are identified by an export control classification number eccn . each number consists of a set of digits and a letter. the first digit identifies the general category within which the entry falls e.g., 3a001 . the letter immediately following this first digit identifies under which of the five groups the item is listed e.g., 3 a001 . the second digit differentiates individual entries by identifying the type of controls associated with the items contained in the entry e.g., 3a001 . listed below are the reasons for control associated with this second digit. i since reasons for control are not mutually exclusive, numbers are assigned in order of precedence. as an example, if an item is controlled for both national security and missile technology reasons, the entry s third alphanumeric character will be a 0 . if the item is controlled only for missile technology the third alphanumeric character will be 1 . ii the numbers in either the second or third digit e.g., 3a001 serve to differentiate between multilateral and unilateral entries. an entry with the number 9 as the second digit, identifies the entire entry as controlled for a unilateral concern e.g., 2b991 for anti-terrorism reasons . if the number 9 appears as the third digit, the item is controlled for unilateral purposes based on a proliferation concern e.g., 2a290 is controlled for unilateral purposes based on nuclear nonproliferation concerns . iii the last digit within each entry e.g., 3a001 is used for the sequential numbering of eccns to differentiate between entries on the ccl. iv last two characters in a 600 series eccn. the last two characters of each 600 series eccn generally track the wassenaar arrangement munitions list waml categories for the types of items at issue. the waml ml21 software and ml22 technology are, however, included in d software and e technology ccl product groups to remain consistent with the structure of the ccl. 2 reading an eccn. an eccn is made up of four sections, the heading, license requirements, license exceptions, and list of items controlled sections. a brief description of each section and its use follows i heading. a description of the items controlled is provided next to each eccn. in certain eccns, the description is a summary and will direct you to see list of items controlled for a complete list of items classified under those respective eccns. the items paragraph in the list of items controlled section will describe all of the items that the eccn controls for the portions of the heading that precede the see list of items controlled phrase. portions of the heading that follow the phrase are complete descriptions of the items controlled by that portion of the heading. if see list of items controlled appears at the end of the heading, the items paragraph in the list of items controlled section is the exclusive, complete list of the items the eccn controls. ii license requirements. this section contains a separate line identifying all possible reasons for control in order of precedence, and two columns entitled control s and country chart . a the controls header identifies all applicable reasons for control, in order of restrictiveness, and to what extent each applies e.g., to the entire entry or only to certain subparagraphs . those requiring licenses for a larger number of countries and or items are listed first. as you read down the list the number of countries and or items requiring a license declines. since reasons for control are not mutually exclusive, items controlled within a particular eccn may be controlled for more than one reason. the following is a list of all possible reasons for control b the country chart header identifies, for each applicable reason for control, a column name and number e.g., cb column 1 . these column identifiers are used to direct you from the ccl to the appropriate column identifying the countries requiring a license. consult part 742 of the ear for an indepth discussion of the licensing requirements and policies applicable to each country chart column. iii license exceptions. this section provides a brief eligibility statement for each eccn-driven license exception that may be applicable to your transaction, and should be consulted only after you have determined a license is required based on an analysis of the entry and the country chart. the brief eligibility statement in this section is provided to assist you in deciding which eccn-driven license exception related to your particular item and destination you should explore prior to submitting an application. the term yes followed in some instances by the scope of yes appears next to each available eccn-driven license exception. some eccns have license exception sta exclusion paragraphs. these paragraphs identify items for which the license exception sta provisions in 740.20 c 2 of the ear may not be used, but do not otherwise affect license exception sta availability. the term n a will be noted for license exceptions that are not available within a particular entry. in some 600 series eccns, the sta license exception paragraph or a note to the license exceptions section contains additional information on the availability of license exception sta for that eccn. if one or more license exceptions appear to apply to your transaction, you must consult part 740 of the ear to review the conditions and restrictions applicable to each available license exception. the list of license exceptions contained within each eccn is not an all-exclusive list. other license exceptions, not based on particular eccns, may be available. consult part 740 of the ear to determine eligibility for non-eccn-driven license exceptions. iv list of items controlled a related definitions. this header identifies, where appropriate, definitions or parameters that apply to all items controlled by the entry. the information provided in this section is unique to the entry, and hence not listed in the definitions contained in part 772 of the ear. b related controls. if another u.s. government agency or department has export licensing authority over items related to those controlled by an entry, a statement is included identifying the agency or department along with the applicable regulatory cite. an additional cross-reference may be included in instances where the scope of controls differs between a ccl entry and its corresponding entry on list maintained by the european union. this information is provided to assist readers who use both lists. c items. this paragraph describes the relationship between the items paragraph and eccn headings and will assist your understanding as you classify items on the ccl. when the heading contains the phrase see list of items controlled, the portion of the heading preceding that phrase is only a summary of the items controlled by the eccn and the items paragraph contains an exclusive list of items described in the heading. paragraphs d 2 iv c 1 , 2 and 3 of this section provide examples of the three different uses of the phrase see list of items controlled in eccn headings. each heading on the ccl uses one of these three structures. understanding the relationship between the heading and the items paragraph is important when classifying items that are subject to the ear on the ccl. 1 see list of items controlled is at the end of the eccn heading. an example of an eccn where all of the heading text precedes the phrase see list of items controlled is eccn 8a002 marine systems, equipment, parts and components, as follows see list of items controlled . eccns 1a001, 3a001, 6a001, 7a004 and 9a012 are other examples where all of the heading text precedes the phrase see list of items controlled . in these types of headings, the items paragraphs must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the heading and classified under that eccn. 2 see list of items controlled is in the middle of the eccn heading. if the phrase see list of items controlled appears in the middle of the eccn heading, then all portions of the heading that follow the phrase see list of items controlled will list items controlled in addition to the list in the items paragraph. an example of such a heading is eccn 2b992 non- numerically controlled machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces, see list of items controlled and specially designed parts and components therefor. under the eccn 2b992 example, the items paragraph must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the first part of the heading non- numerically controlled machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces and classified under 2b992. the second part of the eccn 2b992 heading and specially designed parts and components therefor contains the exclusive list described in the heading. eccns 1a006, 3b992, 4a001, 6a006 and 7a001 are other examples where the phrase see list of items controlled appears in the middle of the eccn heading. 3 eccns that do not use the phrase see list of items controlled . when all items classified in the eccn are listed in the heading, a sentence is generally included in the items paragraph to direct you to the heading. an example of such a heading is eccn 4e980 technology for the development, production or use of commodities controlled by 4a980. eccns

738.4,"a using the ccl and the country chart 1 overview. once you have determined that your item is classified under a specific eccn, you must use information contained in the license requirements section of that eccn in combination with the country chart to decide whether a license is required. note that not all license requirements set forth under the license requirements section of an eccn refer you to the commerce country chart, but in some cases this section will contain references to a specific section in the ear for license requirements. in such cases, this section would not apply. 2 license decision making process. the following decision making process must be followed in order to determine whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific destination i examine the appropriate eccn in the ccl. is the item you intend to export or reexport controlled for a single reason for control a if yes, identify the single reason for control and the relevant country chart column identifier e.g., cb column 1 . b if no, identify the country chart column identifier for each applicable reason for control e.g., ns column 1, np column 1, etc. . ii review the country chart. with each of the applicable country chart column identifiers noted, turn to the country chart supplement no. 1 to part 738 . locate the correct country chart column identifier on the diagonal headings, and determine whether an x is marked in the cell next to the country in question for each country chart column identified in the applicable eccn. if your item is subject to more than one reason for control, repeat this step using each unique country chart column identifier. a if yes, a license application must be submitted based on the particular reason for control and destination, unless a license exception applies. if yes is noted next to any of the listed license exceptions, you should consult part 740 of the ear to determine whether you can use any of the available eccn-driven license exceptions to effect your shipment, rather than applying for a license. each affirmative license requirement must be overcome by a license exception. if you are unable to qualify for a license exception based on each license requirement noted on the country chart, you must apply for a license. note that other license exceptions, not related to the ccl, may also apply to your transaction see part 740 of the ear . b if no, a license is not required based on the particular reason for control and destination. provided that general prohibitions four through ten do not apply to your proposed transaction and the license requirement section does not refer you to any other part of the ear to determine license requirements. for example, any applicable encryption classification requirements described in 740.17 b of the ear must be met for certain mass market encryption items to affect your shipment using the symbol nlr. proceed to parts 758 and 762 of the ear for information on export clearance procedures and recordkeeping requirements. note that although you may stop after determining a license is required based on the first reason for control, it is best to work through each applicable reason for control. a full analysis of every possible licensing requirement based on each applicable reason for control is required to determine the most advantageous license exception available for your particular transaction and, if a license is required, ascertain the scope of review conducted by bis on your license application. b sample analysis using the ccl and country chart 1 scope. the following sample entry and related analysis is provided to illustrate the type of thought process you must complete in order to determine whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific destination using the ccl in combination with the country chart. 2 sample ccl entry. 3 sample analysis. after consulting the ccl, i determine my item, valued at $10,000, is classified under eccn 2a000.a. i read that the entire entry is controlled for national security, and anti-terrorism reasons. because my item is classified under paragraph .a, and not .b, i understand that though nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to a portion of the entry, they do not apply to my item. i note that the appropriate country chart column identifiers are ns column 2 and at column 1. turning to the country chart, i locate my specific destination, chad, and see that an x appears in the ns column 2 cell for chad, but not in the at column 1 cell. i understand that a license is required, unless my transaction qualifies for a license exception. from the license exception lvs value listed in the entry, i know immediately that my proposed transaction exceeds the value limitation associated with lvs. noting that license exception gbs is yes for this entry, i turn to part 740 of the ear to review the provisions related to use of gbs."

involved, or poses a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the united states and those acting on behalf of such entities may be added to the entity list pursuant to this section. an entity may pose a significant risk through certain circumstances that may be outside of its own control. such circumstances that may place an entity at significant risk include situations involving a sustained lack of cooperation by a host government authority, for example, by preventing an end-use check from being conducted, that effectively prevents bis from determining compliance with the ear. this section may not be used to place on the entity list any party to which exports or reexports require a

or the directorate of defense trade controls of the department of state by i the entity precluding access to refusing to provide information about or providing false or misleading information about parties to the transaction or the item to be checked. the conduct in this example includes expressly refusing to permit a check providing false or misleading information or engaging in dilatory or evasive conduct that effectively prevents the check from occurring or makes the check inaccurate or useless. a nexus between the conduct of the party to be listed and the failure to produce a complete, accurate and useful check is required, even though an express refusal by the party to be listed is not required or ii a sustained lack of cooperation by the host government to schedule and facilitate the completion of an end-use check of entities identified on the unverified list pursuant to 744.15, resulting in sufficient concern such that the end-user review committee believes that prior review of exports, reexports, or transfers in-country involving the entity and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denial enhance bis s ability to prevent violations of the ear. 5 engaging in conduct that poses a risk of violating the ear when such conduct raises sufficient concern that the end-user review committee believes that prior review of exports, reexports, or

this part or 3 the export, reexport, or transfer in-country of specified items to a certain party because there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that the entity has been involved, is involved, or poses a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the united states, including the foreign policy interest of the protection of human rights throughout the world, and those acting on behalf of such entity. specific notice will be given only by, or at the direction of,

transaction. in reexport or routed export transactions, a u.s. agent acting on behalf of a foreign principal party in interest may be the licensee in these cases, both the agent and the foreign principal party in interest, on whose behalf the agent has acted, are responsible for the use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. it is the licensee s responsibility to communicate in writing the specific license conditions to the parties to whom those conditions apply. in addition, when required by the license, the licensee is responsible for obtaining written acknowledgment s of receipt of the conditions from the party ies to whom those conditions apply. e prohibited use of a license. no person convicted of a violation of any statute specified in section 11 h of the eaa, at the discretion of the secretary of commerce, may apply for any license

both the quantity and value listed on the license. g license validity period. licenses involving the export or reexport of items will generally have a four-year validity period, unless a different validity period has been requested and specifically approved by bis or is otherwise specified on the license at the time that it is issued. exceptions from the four-year validity period include license applications for items controlled for short supply reasons, which will be limited to a 12-month validity period and license applications reviewed and approved as an emergency see 748.4 h of the ear . emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of the calendar month following the month in which the emergency license is issued. the expiration date will be clearly stated on the face of the license. if the expiration date falls on a legal holiday federal or state , the validity period is automatically extended to midnight of the first business day following the expiration date. 1 extended validity period. bis will consider granting a validity period exceeding 4 years on a case-by-case basis when extenuating circumstances warrant such an extension. requests for such extensions may be made at the time of application or after the license has been issued and it is still valid. bis will not approve changes regarding other aspects of the license, such as the parties to the transaction and the countries of ultimate destination. an extended validity period will generally be granted where, for example, the transaction is related to a multi-year project when the period corresponds to the duration of a manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement, warehouse and distribution agreement, or license issued under the international traffic in arms regulations when production lead time will not permit an export or reexport during the original validity period of the license when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipment within the 4-year validity of the license or for other similar circumstances. 2 request for extension. i the applicant must submit a letter in writing to request an extension in the validity period of a previously approved

of licenses 1 licenses for temporary exports or reexports. if you have been granted a license for the temporary export or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items to the united states, you must submit a license application requesting authorization to dispose of the items. except when the items are to be used on a temporary basis at a new destination and returned to the united states after such use , you must ensure that your license application is accompanied by all documents that would be required if you had requested a license to export or reexport the same item directly to the new destination. 2 intransit within the united states. if you have been issued a license authorizing an intransit shipment that does not qualify for the intransit provisions of license exception tmp through the united states, your license will be valid only for the export of the intransit shipment wholly of foreign origin and for which a transportation and exportation customs entry or an immediate exportation customs entry is outstanding. 3 intransit outside the united states. if you have been issued a license authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in the general prohibition eight contained in 736.2 b 8 of the ear, and you did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the time of the original license application, you must notify bis in writing once you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee. your notification must contain the original license number, and the complete name, address, and telephone number of the intermediate consignee. the written request must be submitted to bis at the address listed in 748.1 d 2 of the ear. 4 replacement license. if you have been issued a replacement license for changes to your original license not covered in paragraph c of this section , you must retain both the original and the replacement license. i terminating license conditions. exporters or reexporters who have shipped under licenses with conditions that would not apply to an export under a license exception or if no license was required, and foreign consignees who have agreed to such conditions, are no longer bound by these conditions when the licensed items become eligible for a license exception or can be exported or reexported without a license. items that become eligible for a license exception are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable license exception and to the restrictions in 740.2 of the ear. items that become eligible for export without a license remain subject to the ear and any export, reexport, or disposition of such items may only be made in accordance with the requirements of the ear. termination of license conditions does not relieve an exporter or reexporter of its responsibility for violations that occurred prior to the availability of a license exception or prior to the removal of license requirements. j records. if you have been issued a license you must retain the license, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 of the ear including any licenses whether used or unused, valid or expired and all supporting documents and shipping

760.1,"in this part, references to the ear are references to 15 cfr chapter vii, subchapter c. a definition of person. for purposes of this part, the term person means any individual, or any association or organization, public or private, which is organized, permanently established, resident, or registered to do business, in the united states or any foreign country. this definition of person includes both the singular and plural and, in addition, includes 1 any partnership, corporation, company, branch, or other form of association or organization, whether organized for profit or non-profit purposes 2 any government, or any department, agency, or commission of any government 3 any trade association, chamber of commerce, or labor union 4 any charitable or fraternal organization and 5 any other association or organization not specifically listed in paragraphs a 1 through 4 of this section. b definition of united states person . 1 this part applies to united states persons. for purposes of this part, the term united states person means any person who is a united states resident or national, including individuals, domestic concerns, and controlled in fact foreign subsidiaries, affiliates, or other permanent foreign establishments of domestic concerns. this definition of united states person includes both the singular and plural and, in addition, includes i the government of the united states or any department, agency, or commission thereof ii the government of any state of the united states, the district of columbia, the commonwealth of puerto rico, any territory or possession of the united states, or any subdivision, department, agency, or commission of any such government iii any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other entity

branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern. see paragraph c of this section on definition of controlled in fact . 2 the term domestic concern means any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws of, any jurisdiction named in paragraph b 1 i or ii of this section, or any permanent domestic establishment of a foreign concern. 3 the term foreign concern means any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws of, any jurisdiction other than those named in paragraph b 1 i or ii of this section. 4 the term united states person does not include an individual united states national who is resident outside the united states and who is either employed permanently or temporarily by a non-united states person or assigned to work as an employee for, and under the direction and control of, a non-united states person. c definition of controlled in fact . 1 this part applies to any domestic concern s foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern. control in fact consists of the authority or ability of a domestic concern to establish the general policies or to control day-to-day operations of its foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment. 2 a foreign subsidiary or affiliate of a domestic concern will be presumed to be controlled in fact by that domestic concern, subject to rebuttal by competent evidence, when i the domestic concern beneficially owns or controls whether directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate ii the domestic concern beneficially owns or controls whether directly or indirectly 25 percent or more of the voting securities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate, if no other person owns or controls whether directly or indirectly an equal or larger percentage iii the foreign subsidiary or affiliate is operated by the domestic concern pursuant to the

to appoint the chief operating officer of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate. 3 a brokerage firm or other person which holds simple record ownership of securities for the convenience of clients will not be deemed to control the securities. 4 a domestic concern which owns, directly or indirectly, securities that are immediately convertible at the option of the holder or owner into voting securities is presumed to own or control those voting securities. 5 a domestic concern s foreign branch office or other unincorporated permanent foreign establishment is deemed to be controlled in fact by such domestic concern under all circumstances. d definition of activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states . e intent . 1 this part prohibits a united states person from taking or knowingly agreeing to take certain specified actions with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. 2 a united states person has the intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott when such a boycott is at least one of the reasons for that person s decision whether to take a particular prohibited action. so long as that is at least one of the reasons for that person s action, a violation occurs regardless of whether the prohibited action is also taken for non-boycott reasons. stated differently, the fact that such action was taken for legitimate business reasons does not remove that action from the scope of this part if compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott was also a reason for the action. 3 intent is a necessary element of any violation of any of the prohibitions under 760.2. it is not sufficient that one take action that is specifically prohibited by this part. it is essential that one take such action with intent to comply with, further,or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. accordingly, a person who inadvertently, without boycott intent, takes a prohibited action, does not commit any violation of this part. 4 intent in this context means the reason or purpose for one s behavior. it does not mean that one has to agree with the boycott in question or desire that it succeed or that it be furthered or supported. but it does mean that the reason why a particular prohibited action was taken must be established. 5 reason or purpose can be proved by circumstantial evidence. for example, if a person receives a request to supply certain boycott information, the furnishing of which is prohibited by this part, and he knowingly supplies that information in response, he clearly intends to comply with that boycott request. it is irrelevant that he may disagree with or object to the boycott itself. information will be deemed to be furnished with the requisite intent if the person furnishing the information knows that it was sought for boycott purposes. on the other hand, if a person refuses to do business with someone who happens to be blacklisted, but the reason is because that person produces an inferior product, the requisite intent does not exist. 6 actions will be deemed to be taken with intent to comply with an unsanctioned foreign boycott if the person taking such action knew that such action was required or requested for boycott reasons. on the other hand, the mere absence of a business relationship with a blacklisted person or with or in a boycotted country does not indicate the existence of the requisite intent. 7 in seeking to determine whether the requisite intent exists, all available evidence will be examined."
760.2,"a refusals to do business. 1 no united states person may refuse, knowingly agree to refuse, require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require any other person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or with any other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with the boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, or a request from or on behalf of the boycotting country. 2 generally, a refusal to do business under this section consists of action that excludes a person or country from a transaction for boycott reasons. this includes a situation in which a united states person chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis or takes action to carry out another person s boycott-based selection when he knows or has reason to know that the other person s selection is boycott-based. 3 refusals to do business which are prohibited by this section include not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by a course or pattern of conduct. there need not be a specific offer and refusal to constitute a refusal to do business a refusal may occur when a united states person has a financial or commercial opportunity and declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it. 4 a united states person s use of either a boycott-based list of persons with whom he will not deal a so-called blacklist or a boycott-based list of persons with whom he will deal a so-called whitelist constitutes a refusal to do business. 5 an agreement by a united states person to comply generally with the laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business or an agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply or govern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. nor, in and of itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a person to assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal to do business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such a clause. but see 760.4 of this part on evasion. 6 if, for boycott reasons, a united states general manager chooses one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with one supplier over another, or advises its client to do so, then the general manager s actions constitute a refusal to do business under this section. however, it is not a refusal to do business under this section for a united states person to provide management, procurement, or other pre-award services for another person so long as the provision of such pre-award services is customary for that firm or industry of which the firm is a part , without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting character of the countries in which they are performed, and the united states person, in providing such services, does not act to exclude a person or country from the transaction for boycott reasons, or otherwise take actions that are boycott-based. for example, a united states person under contract to provide general management services in connection with a construction project in a boycotting country may compile lists of qualified bidders for the client if that service is a customary one and if persons who are qualified are not excluded from that list because they are blacklisted. 7 with respect to post-award services, if a client makes a boycott-based selection, actions taken by the united states general manager or contractor to carry out the client s choice are themselves refusals to do business if the united states contractor knows or has reason to know that the client s choice was boycott-based. it is irrelevant whether the united states contractor also provided pre-award services. such actions include entering into a contract with the selected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client s choice, executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspection and shipment of the supplier s goods, or taking any other action to effect the client s choice. but see 760.3 d on compliance with unilateral selection as it may apply to post-award services. 8 an agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of this section since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant not only to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or on behalf of, a boycotting country. 9 agreements under this section may be either express or implied by a course or pattern of conduct. there need not be a direct request from a boycotting country for action by a united states person to have been taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycotting country. 10 this prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a united states person s activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. the mere absence of a business relationship with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with national s or resident s of the boycotted country, or with any other person does not indicate the existence of the required intent. b discriminatory actions. 1 no united states person may i refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against any individual who is a united states person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin ii discriminate against any corporation or other organization which is a united states person on the basis of the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such corporation or organization iii knowingly agree to take any of the actions described in paragraph b 1 i and ii of this section or iv require or knowingly agree to require any other person to take any of the actions described in paragraph b 1 i and ii of this section. 2 this prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory action is taken by a united states person on its own or in response to an agreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country. this prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a united states person s activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. 3 the section does not supersede or limit the operation of the civil rights laws of the united states. c furnishing information about race, religion, sex, or national origin. 1 no united states person may i furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any united states person ii furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation or other organization which is a united states person iii knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any united states person or iv knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation or other organization which is a united states person. 2 this prohibition shall apply whether the information is specifically requested or is offered voluntarily by the united states person. it shall also apply whether the information requested or volunteered is stated in the affirmative or the negative. 3 information about the place of birth of or the nationality of the parents of a united states person comes within this prohibition, as does information in the form of code words or symbols which could identify a united states person s race, religion, sex, or national origin. 4 this prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a united states person s activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. d furnishing information about business relationships with boycotted countries or blacklisted persons. 1 no united states person may furnish or knowingly agree to furnish information concerning his or any other person s past, present or proposed business relationships i with or in a boycotted country ii with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country iii with any national or resident of a boycotted country or iv with any other person who is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country. 2 this prohibition shall apply i whether the information pertains to a business relationship involving a sale, purchase, or supply transaction legal or commercial representation shipping or other transportation transaction insurance investment or any other type of business transaction or relationship and ii whether the information is directly or indirectly requested or is furnished on the initiative of the united states person. 3 this prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context. normal business information may relate to factors such as financial fitness, technical competence, or professional experience, and may be found in documents normally available to the public such as annual reports, disclosure statements concerning securities, catalogs, promotional brochures, and trade and business handbooks. such information may also appear in specifications or statements of experience and qualifications. 4 normal business information furnished in a commercial context does not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the information may be a boycotting country or a national or resident thereof. if the information is of a type which is generally sought for a legitimate business purpose such as determining financial fitness, technical competence, or professional experience , the information may be furnished even if the information could be used, or without the knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be used, for boycott purposes. however, no information about business relationships with blacklisted persons or boycotted countries, their residents or nationals, may be furnished in response to a boycott request, even if the information is publicly available. requests for such information from a boycott office will be presumed to be boycott-based. 5 this prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a united states person s activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. e information concerning association with charitable and fraternal organizations. 1 no united states person may furnish or knowingly agree to furnish information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports a boycotted country. 2 this prohibition shall apply whether i the information concerns association with or involvement in any charitable or fraternal organization which a has, as one of its stated purposes, the support of a boycotted country through financial contributions or other means, or b undertakes, as a major organizational activity, to offer financial or other support to a boycotted country ii the information is directly or indirectly requested or is furnished on the initiative of the united states person or iii the information requested or volunteered concerns membership in, financial contributions to, or any other type of association with or involvement in the activities of such charitable or fraternal organization. 3 this prohibition does not prohibit the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context as defined in paragraph d of this section. 4 this prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a united states person s activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. f letters of credit. 1 no united states person may pay, honor, confirm, or otherwise implement a letter of credit which contains a condition or requirement compliance with which is prohibited by this part, nor shall any united states person, as a result of the application of this section, be obligated to pay, honor or otherwise implement such a letter of credit. 2 for purposes of this section, implementing a letter of credit includes i issuing or opening a letter of credit at the request of a customer ii honoring, by accepting as being a valid instrument of credit, any letter of credit iii paying, under a letter of credit, a draft or other demand for payment by the beneficiary iv confirming a letter of credit by agreeing to be responsible for payment to the beneficiary in response to a request by the issuer v negotiating a letter of credit by voluntarily purchasing a draft from a beneficiary and presenting such draft for reimbursement to the issuer or the confirmer of the letter of credit and vi taking any other action to implement a letter of credit. 3 in the standard international letter of credit transaction facilitating payment for the export of goods from the united states, a bank in a foreign country may be requested by its customer to issue a revocable or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the united states exporter. the customer usually requires, and the letter of credit provides, that the issuing or a confirming bank will make payment to the beneficiary against the bank s receipt of the documentation specified in the letter of credit. such documentation usually includes commercial and consular invoices, a bill of lading, and evidence of insurance, but it may also include other required certifications or documentary assurances such as the origin of the goods and information relating to the carrier or insurer of the shipment.banks usually will not accept drafts for payment unless the documents submitted therewith comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. 4 a united states person is not prohibited under this section from advising a beneficiary of the existence of a letter of credit in his favor, or from taking ministerial actions to dispose of a letter of credit which it is prohibited from implementing. 5 compliance with this section shall provide an absolute defense in any action brought to compel payment of, honoring of, or other implementation of a letter of credit, or for damages resulting from failure to pay or otherwise honor or implement the letter of credit. this section shall not otherwise relieve any person from any obligations or other liabilities he may incur under other laws or regulations, except as may be explicitly provided in this section. 6 this prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a united states person s activities taken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. in addition, it applies only when the transaction to which the letter of credit applies is in united states commerce and the beneficiary is a united states person. 7 a letter of credit implemented in the united states by a united states person located in the united states, including a permanent united states establishment of a foreign bank, will be presumed to apply to a transaction in united states commerce and to be in favor of a united states beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a united states address for the beneficiary. these presumptions may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is not a united states person or that the underlying transaction is not in united states commerce. 8 where a letter of credit implemented in the united states by a united states person located in the united states does not specify a united states address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be presumed to be other than a united states person. this presumption may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is a united states person despite the foreign address. 9 a letter of credit implemented outside the united states by a united states person located outside the united states will be presumed to apply to a transaction in united states commerce and to be in favor of a united states beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a united states address for the beneficiary and calls for documents indicating shipment from the united states or otherwise indicating that the goods are of united states origin. these presumptions may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is not a united states person or that the underlying transaction is not in united states commerce. 10 where a letter of credit implemented outside the united states by a united states person located outside the united states does not specify a united states address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be presumed to be other than a united states person. in addition, where such a letter of credit does not call for documents indicating shipment from the united states or otherwise indicating that the goods are of united states origin, the transaction to which it applies will be presumed to be outside united states commerce. the presumption that the beneficiary is other than a united states person may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is a united states person. the presumption that the transaction to which the letter of credit applies is outside united states commerce may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the underlying transaction is in united states commerce."
760.3,"a import requirements of a boycotting country. 1 a united states person, in supplying goods or services to a boycotting country, or to a national or resident of a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of such boycotting country which prohibit the import of i goods or services from the boycotted country ii goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country or iii goods produced or services provided by nationals or residents of the boycotted country. 2 a united states person may comply or agree to comply with such import requirements whether or not he has received a specific request to comply. by its terms, this exception applies only to transactions involving imports into a boycotting country. a united states person may not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a boycotted country. 3 in taking action within the scope of this exception, a united states person is limited in the types of boycott-related information he can supply. see 760.2 d of this part on furnishing information about business relationships with boycotted countries or blacklisted persons and paragraph c of this section on import and shipping document requirements. b shipment of goods to a boycotting country. 1 a united states person, in shipping goods to a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of that country which prohibit the shipment of goods i on a carrier of the boycotted country or ii by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment. 2 a specific request that a united states person comply or agree to comply with requirements concerning the use of carriers of a boycotted country is not necessary if the united states person knows, or has reason to know, that the use of such carriers for shipping goods to the boycotting country is prohibited by requirements of the boycotting country. this exception applies whether a boycotting country or the purchaser of the shipment i explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through a port of the boycotted country or ii affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not include a port in the boycotted country. 3 for purposes of this exception, the term carrier of a boycotted country means a carrier which flies the flag of a boycotted country or which is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by a boycotted country or by nationals or residents of a boycotted country. c import and shipping document requirements. 1 a united states person, in shipping goods to a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with import and shipping document requirements of that country, with respect to i the country or origin of the goods ii the name and nationality of the carrier iii the route of the shipment iv the name, residence, or address of the supplier of the shipment v the name, residence, or address of the provider of other services. 2 such information must be stated in positive, non-blacklisting, non-exclusionary terms except for information with respect to the names or nationalities of carriers or routes of shipment, which may continue to be stated in negative terms in conjunction with shipments to a boycotting country, in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks or confiscation. d unilateral and specific selection. 1 a united states person may comply or agree to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, a national of a boycotting country, or a resident of a boycotting country including a united states person who is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country of carriers, insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or specific goods, provided that with respect to services, it is necessary and customary that a not insignificant part of the services be performed within the boycotting country. with respect to goods, the items, in the normal course of business, must be identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by a uniqueness of design or appearance or b trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging. 2 this exception pertains to what is permissible for a united states person who is the recipient of a unilateral and specific selection of goods or services to be furnished by a third person. it does not pertain to whether the act of making such a selection is permitted that question is covered, with respect to united states persons, in paragraph g of this section on compliance with local law. nor does it pertain to the united states person who is the recipient of an order to supply its own goods or services. nothing in this part prohibits or restricts a united states person from filling an order himself, even if he is selected by the buyer on a boycott basis e.g., because he is not blacklisted , so long as he does not himself take any action prohibited by this part. 3 in order for this exception to apply, the selection with which a united states person wishes to comply must be unilateral and specific. 4 a specific selection is one which is stated in the affirmative and which specifies a particular supplier of goods or services. 5 a unilateral selection is one in which the discretion in making the selection is exercised by the boycotting country buyer. if the united states person who receives a unilateral selection has provided the buyer with any boycott-based assistance including information for purposes of helping the buyer select someone on a boycott basis , then the buyer s selection is not unilateral, and compliance with that selection by a united states person does not come within this exception. 6 the provision of so-called pre-selection or pre-award services, such as providing lists of qualified suppliers, subcontractors, or bidders, does not, in and of itself, destroy the unilateral character of a selection, provided such services are not boycott-based. lists of qualified suppliers, for example, must not exclude anyone because he is blacklisted. moreover, such services must be of the type customarily provided in similar transactions by the firm or industry of which the firm is a part as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries. if such services are not customarily provided in similar transactions or such services are provided in such a way as to exclude blacklisted persons from participating in a transaction or diminish their opportunity for such participation, then the services may not be provided without destroying the unilateral character of any subsequent selection. 7 in order for this exception to be available, the unilateral and specific selection must have been made by a boycotting country, or by a national or resident of a boycotting country. such a resident may be a united states person. for purposes of this exception, a united states person will be considered a resident of a boycotting country only if he is a bona fide resident. a united states person may be a bona fide resident of a boycotting country even if such person s residency is temporary. 8 factors that will be considered in determining whether a united states person is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country include i physical presence in the country ii whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons iii continuity of the residency iv intent to maintain the residency v prior residence in the country vi size and nature of presence in the country vii whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated in the country viii whether the person has a valid work visa and ix whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business activities. 9 the boycotting country resident must be the one actually making the selection. if a selection is made by a non-resident agent, parent, subsidiary, affiliate, home office or branch office of a boycotting country resident, it is not a selection by a resident within the meaning of this exception. 10 a selection made solely by a bona fide resident and merely transmitted by another person to a united states person for execution is a selection by a bona fide resident within the meaning of this exception. 11 if a united states person receives, from another person located in the united states, what may be a unilateral selection by a boycotting country customer, and knows or has reason to know that the selection is made for boycott reasons, he has a duty to inquire of the transmitting person to determine who actually made the selection. if he knows or has reason to know that the selection was made by other than a boycotting country, or a national or resident of a boycotting country, he may not comply. a course or pattern of conduct which a united states person recognizes or should recognize as consistent with boycott restrictions will create a duty to inquire. 12 if the united states person does not know or have reason to know that the selection it receives is boycott-based, its compliance with such a selection does not offend any prohibition and this exception is not needed. 13 this exception applies only to compliance with selections of certain types of suppliers of services-carriers, insurers, and suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country. services to be performed wholly within the united states or wholly within any country other than the boycotting country are not covered. 14 for purposes of this part, services are to be performed within the boycotting country only if they are of a type which would customarily be performed by suppliers of those services within the country of the recipient of those services, and if the part of the services performed within the boycotting country is a necessary and not insignificant part of the total services performed. 15 what is customary and necessary for these purposes depends on the usual practice of the supplier of the services or the industry of which he is a part as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries, except where such practices are instituted to accommodate this part. 16 this exception applies only to compliance with selections of certain types of goods goods that, in the normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country. the definition of specifically identifiable goods is the same under this section as it is in paragraph g of this section on compliance with local law. 17 goods specifically identifiable in the normal course of business are those items which at the time of their entry into a boycotting country are identifiable as to source or origin by uniqueness of design or appearance or trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging. goods are specifically identifiable in the normal course of business if their source or origin is ascertainable by inspection of the items themselves, including their packaging, regardless of whether inspection takes place. goods are not considered to be specifically identifiable in the normal course of business if a trademark, trade name, or other form of identification not normally present is added to the items themselves, including their packaging, to accommodate this part. 18 if a unilateral selection meets the conditions described in paragraph d of this section, the united states person receiving the unilateral selection may comply or agree to comply, even if he knows or has reason to know that the selection was boycott-based. however, no united states person may comply or agree to comply with any unilateral selection if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effect discrimination against any united states person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin. e shipment and transshipment of exports pursuant to a boycotting country s requirements. 1 a united states person may comply or agree to comply with the export requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipments or transshipments of exports to i a boycotted country ii any business concern of a boycotted country iii any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country or iv any national or resident of a boycotted country. 2 this exception permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country on indirect exports to a boycotted country i.e., those that pass via third parties and on exports to residents, nationals, or business concerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country, including those located in third countries. 3 this exception also permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments when the restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the export shipments from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of the boycotted country. this exception applies whether a boycotting country or the vendor of the shipment i explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through the boycotted country enroute to its final destination or ii affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not include the boycotted country. 4 a united states person may not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a boycotted country. f immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a boycotting country. 1 a united states individual may comply or agree to comply with the immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a boycotting country, and with requests for information from a boycotting country made to ascertain whether such individual meets requirements for employment within the boycotting country, provided that he furnishes information only about himself or a member of his family, and not about any other united states individual, including his employees, employers, or co-workers. 2 for purposes of this section, a united states individual means a person who is a resident or national of the united states. family means immediate family members, including parents, siblings, spouse, children, and other dependents living in the individual s home. 3 a united states person may not furnish information about its employees or executives, but may allow any individual to respond on his own to any request for information relating to immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements. a united states person may also perform any ministerial acts to expedite processing of applications by individuals. these include informing employees of boycotting country visa requirements at an appropriate time typing, translation, messenger and similar services and assisting in or arranging for the expeditious processing of applications. all such actions must be undertaken on a non-discriminatory basis. 4 a united states person may proceed with a project in a boycotting country even if certain of its employees or other prospective participants in a transaction are denied entry for boycott reasons. but no employees or other participants may be selected in advance in a manner designed to comply with a boycott. g compliance with local law. 1 this exception contains two parts. the first covers compliance with local law with respect to a united states person s activities exclusively within a foreign country the second covers compliance with local import laws by united states persons resident in a foreign country. under both parts of this exception, local laws are laws of the host country, whether derived from statutes, regulations, decrees, or other official sources having the effect of law in the host country. this exception is not available for compliance with presumed policies or understandings of policies unless those policies are reflected in official sources having the effect of law. 2 both parts of this exception apply only to united states persons resident in a foreign country. for purposes of this exception, a united states person will be considered to be a resident of a foreign country only if he is a bona fide resident. a united states person may be a bona fide resident of a foreign country even if such person s residency is temporary. 3 i factors that will be considered in determining whether a united states person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country include a physical presence in the country b whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons c continuity of the residency d intent to maintain the residency e prior residence in the country f size and nature of presence in the country g whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated in the country h whether the person has a valid work visa and i whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business activities. ii no one of the factors in paragraph g 3 of this section is dispositive. all the circumstances involved will be closely examined to ascertain whether there is, in fact, bona fide residency. residency established solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of this part, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bona fide residency. h activities exclusively within a foreign country. 1 any united states person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his activities exclusively within that country. these activities include i entering into contracts which provide that local law applies or governs, or that the parties will comply with such laws ii employing residents of the host country iii retaining local contractors to perform work within the host country iv purchasing or selling goods or services from or to residents of the host country and v furnishing information within the host country. 2 activities exclusively within the country do not include importing goods or services from outside the host country, and, therefore, this part of the exception does not apply to compliance with import laws in connection with importing goods or services. i compliance with local import law. 1 any united states person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting country, may, in importing goods, materials or components into that country, comply or agree to comply with the import laws of that country, provided that i the items are for his own use or for his use in performing contractual services within that country and ii in the normal course of business, the items are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the foreign country by a uniqueness of design or appearance or b trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging. 2 the factors that will be considered in determining whether a united states person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country are those set forth in paragraph g of this section. bona fide residence of a united states company s subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent establishment in a foreign country does not confer such residence on such united states company. likewise, bona fide residence of a united states company s employee in a foreign country does not confer such residence on the entire company. 3 a united states person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country may take action under this exception through an agent outside the country, but the agent must act at the direction of the resident and not exercise his own discretion. therefore, if a united states person resident in a boycotting country takes action to comply with a boycotting country s import law with respect to the importation of qualified goods, he may direct his agent in the united states on the action to be taken, but the united states agent himself may not exercise any discretion. 4 for purposes of this exception, the test that governs whether goods or components of goods are specifically identifiable is identical to the test applied in paragraph d of this section on compliance with unilateral and specific selection to determine whether they are identifiable as to their source or origin in the normal course of business. 5 the availability of this exception for the import of goods depends on whether the goods are intended for the united states person s own use at the time they are imported. it does not depend upon who has title to the goods at the time of importation into a foreign country. 6 goods are for the united states person s own use including the performance of contractual services within the foreign country if i they are to be consumed by the united states person ii they are to remain in the united states person s possession and to be used by that person iii they are to be used by the united states person in performing contractual services for another iv they are to be further manufactured, incorporated into, refined into, or reprocessed into another product to be manufactured for another or v they are to be incorporated into, or permanently affixed as a functional part of, a project to be constructed for another. 7 goods acquired to fill an order for such goods from another are not for the united states person s own use. goods procured for another are not for one s own use, even if the furnishing of procurement services is the business in which the united states person is customarily engaged. nor are goods obtained for simple resale acquired for one s own use, even if the united states person is engaged in the retail business. likewise, goods obtained for inclusion in a turnkey project are not for one s own use if they are not customarily incorporated into, or do not customarily become permanently affixed as a functional part of the project. 8 this part of the local law exception does not apply to the import of services, even when the united states person importing such services is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country and is importing them for his own use. in addition, this exception is available for a united states person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country only when the individual or entity actually present within that country takes action through the exercise of his own discretion. 9 use of this exception will be monitored and continually reviewed to determine whether its continued availability is consistent with the national interest. its availability may be limited or withdrawn as appropriate. in reviewing the continued availability of this exception, the effect that the inability to comply with local import laws would have on the economic and other relations of the united states with boycotting countries will be considered. 10 a united states person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country may comply or agree to comply with the host country s import laws even if he knows or has reason to know that particular laws are boycott-related. however, no united states person may comply or agree to comply with any host country law which would require him to discriminate against any united states person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, or to supply information about any united states person s race, religion, sex, or national origin."
760.4,"a no united states person may engage in any transaction or take any other action, either independently or through any other person, with intent to evade the provisions of this part. nor may any united states person assist another united states person to violate or evade the provisions of this part. b the exceptions set forth in 760.3 a through i do not permit activities or agreements express or implied by a course of conduct, including a pattern of responses which are otherwise prohibited by this part and which are not within the intent of such exceptions. however, activities within the coverage and intent of the exceptions set forth in this part do not constitute evasion regardless of how often such exceptions are utilized. c use of any artifice, device or scheme which is intended to place a person at a commercial disadvantage or impose on him special burdens because he is blacklisted or otherwise restricted for boycott reasons from having a business relationship with or in a boycotting country will be regarded as evasion for purposes of this part. d unless permitted under one of the exceptions, use of risk of loss provisions that expressly impose a financial risk on another because of the import laws of a boycotting country may constitute evasion. if they are introduced after january 18, 1978, their use will be presumed to constitute evasion. this presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such a provision is in customary usage without distinction between boycotting and non-boycotting countries and that there is a legitimate non-boycott reason for its use. on the other hand, use of such a provision by a united states person subsequent to january 18, 1978 is presumed not to constitute evasion if the provision had been customarily used by that person prior to january 18, 1978. e use of dummy corporations or other devices to mask prohibited activity will also be regarded as evasion. similarly, it is evasion under this part to divert specific boycotting country orders from a united states parent to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of complying with prohibited boycott requirements. however, alteration of a person s structure or method of doing business will not constitute evasion so long as the alteration is based on legitimate business considerations and is not undertaken solely to avoid the application of the prohibitions of this part. the facts and circumstances of an arrangement or transaction will be carefully scrutinized to see whether appearances conform to reality."
760.5,"a scope of reporting requirements. 1 a united states person who receives a request to take any action which has the effect of furthering or supporting a restrictive trade practice or boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the united states or against any united states person must report such request to the department of commerce in accordance with the requirements of this section. such a request may be either written or oral and may include a request to furnish information or enter into or implement an agreement. it may also include a solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks that a united states person take or refrain from taking a particular action. such a request shall be reported regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or permissible under this part, except as otherwise provided by this section. 2 for purposes of this section, a request received by a united states person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further, support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott or restrictive trade practice. i a request received by a united states person located in the united states is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states, as determined under 760.1 d 1 through 5 and 18 of this part. ii a request received by a united states person located outside the united states that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determined under 760.1 c of this part is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states, as determined under 760.1 d 6 through 17 and 19 of this part. iii a request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to a particular transaction or activity, received by any united states person is reportable when such person has or anticipates a business relationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale, purchase or transfer of goods or services including information in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states, as determined under 760.1 d of this part. 3 these reporting requirements apply to all united states persons. they apply whether the united states person receiving the request is an exporter, bank or other financial institution, insurer, freight forwarder, manufacturer, or any other united states person subject to this part. 4 the acquisition of information about a boycotting country s boycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets, legal texts, exporters guidebooks and other similar publications does not constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of this section. in addition, a united states person who receives an unsolicited invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal. 5 because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycott purposes because of congressional mandates to provide clear and precise guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty and because of the department s commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost of reporting where it will not impair the department s ability to continue to monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are not reportable i a request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier which flies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered, leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residents of a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect. ii a request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a request to refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request to certify to either effect. iii a request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the country of origin of goods. iv a request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shipped or the name of the provider of services. v a request to comply with the laws of another country except where the request expressly requires compliance with that country s boycott laws. vi a request to an individual to supply information about himself or a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, or employment purposes. vii a request to supply an affirmative statement or certification indicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwise indicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at a particular destination. viii a request to supply a certificate by the owner, master, charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck or any other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible, permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, a particular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws, rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries. ix a request to supply a certificate from an insurance company stating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent or representative within a boycotting country and or the name and address of such agent. x a request to comply with a term or condition of a transaction that provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify the purchaser if the vendor s goods are denied entry into a country for any reason risk of loss clause if such clause was in use by the purchaser prior to january 18, 1978. 6 no united states person may engage in any transaction or take any other action, either independently or through any other person, with intent to evade the provisions of this part. 7 from time to time the department will survey domestic concerns for purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requests received by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates with respect to their activities outside united states commerce. this pertains to requests which would be reportable under this section but for the fact that the activities to which the requests relate are outside united states commerce. the information requested will include the number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, the action s requested, the actions s taken in response and the countries in which the requests originate. the results of such surveys, including the names of those surveyed, will be made public. b manner of reporting. 1 each reportable request must be reported. however, if more than one document such as an invitation to bid, purchase order, or letter of credit containing the same boycott request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first such request need be reported. individual shipments against the same purchase order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the same transaction. each different boycott request associated with a given transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the request is received. 2 each united states person actually receiving a reportable request must report that request. however, such person may designate someone else to report on his behalf. for example, a united states company, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreign subsidiary or affiliates a freight forwarder, if authorized, may report on behalf of the exporter and a bank, if authorized, may report on behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. if a person designated to report a request received by another receives an identical request directed to him in connection with the same transaction, he may file one report on behalf of himself and the other person. 3 where a person is designated to report on behalf of another, the person receiving the request remains liable for any failure to report or for any representations made on his behalf. further, anyone reporting on behalf of another is not relieved of his own responsibility for reporting any boycott request which he receives, even if it is an identical request in connection with the same transaction. 4 reports may be submitted by mail or electronically. mailed paper reports must be submitted in duplicate to report processing staff, office of antiboycott compliance, u.s. department of commerce, room 6098, washington, dc 20230. electronic reports must be submitted in duplicate, by following the prompts on the screen, through the office of antiboycott compliance web page of the bis web site, http bis.doc.gov index.php enforcement oac id=300. each submission, whether paper or electronic, must be made in accordance with the following requirements i where the person receiving the request is a united states person located in the united states, each report of requests must be postmarked or electronically date-stamped by the last day of the month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received e.g., april 30 for the quarter consisting of january, february, and march . ii where the person receiving the request is a united states person located outside the united states, each report of requests must be postmarked or electronically date-stamped by the last day of the second month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received e.g., may 31 for the quarter consisting of january, february, and march . 5 mailed paper reports may, at the reporting person s option, be submitted on either a single transaction form form bis 621p, report of request for restrictive trade practice or boycott, single transaction, revised 10 89 or on a multiple transaction form form bis 6051p, report of request for restrictive trade practice or boycott, multiple transactions, revised 10 89 . electronic reports may be submitted only on the single transaction form, which will electronically reproduce the reporting person s identifying information to facilitate reporting of multiple transactions. 6 reports, whether submitted on the paper single transaction form or on the paper multiple transaction form, or submitted electronically, must contain entries for every applicable item on the form, including whether the reporting person intends to take or has taken the action requested. if the reporting person has not decided what action he will take by the time the report is required to be filed, he must later report the action he decides to take within 10 business days after deciding. in addition, anyone filing a report on behalf of another must so indicate and identify that other person. 7 each report of a boycott request, whether submitted by mail or electronically, must be accompanied by two copies of the relevant page s of any document s in which the request appears see, paragraph c 2 of this section . for mail submissions, the relevant pages shall be attached in paper format to the report form for electronic submissions, the relevant pages shall be attached in pdf format to the electronic submission. reports, whether paper or electronic, may also be accompanied by any additional information relating to the request as the reporting person desires to provide concerning his response to the request. for electronic submissions, such additional information should be provided as a pdf attachment. 8 records containing information relating to a reportable boycott request, including a copy of any document s in which the request appears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year period after receipt of the request. the department may require that these materials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any time within that period. see part 762 of the ear for additional recordkeeping requirements. c disclosure of information. 1 reports of requests received on or after october 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary information. with respect to reports of requests received on or after august 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a united states person to whom the report relates would be placed at a competitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of information regarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles, materials, and supplies, including related technical data and other information, whether contained in a report or in any accompanying document s , such information will not be publicly disclosed except upon failure by the reporting entity to edit the public inspection copy of the accompanying document s as provided by paragraph c 2 of this section, unless the secretary of commerce determines that the disclosure would not place the united states person involved at a competitive disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the national interest to withhold the information. in the event the secretary of commerce considers making such a determination concerning competitive disadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will be given before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. in no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be honored. 2 because a copy of any document s accompanying the report will be made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must be submitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reporting entity to delete the same information which it certified in the report would place a united states person at a competitive disadvantage if disclosed. in addition, the reporting entity may delete from this copy information that is considered confidential and that is not required to be contained in the report e.g., information related to foreign consignee . this copy should be conspicuously marked with the legend public inspection copy. with respect to documents accompanying reports received by the department on or after july 1, 1979, the public inspection copy will be made available as submitted whether or not it has been appropriately edited by the reporting entity as provided by this paragraph. 3 reports and accompanying documents which are available to the public for inspection and copying are located in the bis freedom of information records inspection facility, room 4525, department of commerce, 14th street and constitution avenue, n.w., washington, d.c. 20230. requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to that facility. 4 the secretary of commerce will periodically transmit summaries of the information contained in the reports to the secretary of state for such action as the secretary of state, in consultation with the secretary of commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out the policies in section 8 b 2 of the export administration act of 1979."

764.4,"a where to report. if a person learns that an export control violation of the ear has occurred or may occur, that person may notify b failure to report violations. failure to report potential violations may result in the unwarranted issuance of licenses or exports without the required licenses to the detriment of the interests of the united states. c reporting requirement distinguished. the reporting provisions in paragraph a of this section are not reporting requirements within the meaning of 764.2 i of this part. d formerly embargoed destinations. reporting requirements for activities within the scope of 764.2 e that involve items subject to the ear which may have been illegally exported or reexported to libya prior to the lifting of the comprehensive embargo on libya are found in 764.7 of the ear."
764.5,"a general policy. bis strongly encourages disclosure to oee if you believe that you may have violated the ear, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by oee. b limitations. 1 the provisions of this section do not apply to disclosures of violations relating to part 760 of the ear. 2 the provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to oee for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under part 766 of the ear for violations of the export control provisions of the ear. 3 the provisions of this section apply only when information is received by oee for review prior to the time that oee, or any other agency of the united states government, has learned the same or substantially similar information from another source and has commenced an investigation or inquiry in connection with that information. 4 while voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by oee, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors in a case. the weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely within the discretion of oee, and the mitigating effect of voluntary self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. voluntary self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the department of justice for criminal prosecution. in such a case, oee would notify the department of justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the consideration of that factor is within the discretion of the department of justice. 5 a firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm s senior management. 6 the provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter. c information to be provided 1 general. any person wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify oee as soon as possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all export-related transactions where violations are suspected. 2 initial notification i manner and content of initial notification. the initial notification should be in writing and be sent to the address in paragraph c 7 of this section. the notification should include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations, and should designate a contact person regarding the initial notification and provide that contact person s current business street address, email address, and telephone number. the notification should describe the general nature and extent of the violations. oee recognizes that there may be situations where it will not be practical to make an initial notification in writing. for example, written notification may not be practical if a shipment leaves the united states without the required license, yet there is still an opportunity to prevent acquisition of the items by unauthorized persons. in such situations, oee should be contacted promptly at the office listed in paragraph c 7 of this section. ii initial notification date. for purposes of calculating when a complete narrative account must be submitted under paragraph c 2 iii of this section, the initial notification date is the date the notification is received by oee. oee will notify the disclosing party in writing of the date that it receives the initial notification. at oee s discretion, such writing from oee may be on paper, or in an email message or facsimile transmission from oee, or by any other method for the transmission of written communications. where it is not practical to make an initial notification in writing, the person making the notification should confirm the oral notification in writing as soon as possible. iii timely completion of narrative accounts. the narrative account required by paragraph c 3 of this section must be received by oee within 180 days of the initial notification date for purposes of paragraph b 3 of this section, absent an extension from the director of oee. if the person making the initial notification subsequently completes and submits to oee the narrative account required by paragraph c 3 of this section such that oee receives it within 180 days of the initial notification date, or within the additional time, if any, granted by the director of oee pursuant to paragraph c 2 iv of this section, the disclosure, including violations disclosed in the narrative account that were not expressly mentioned in the initial notification, will be deemed to have been made on the initial notification date for purposes of paragraph b 3 of this section if the initial notification was made in compliance with paragraphs c 1 and 2 of this section. failure to meet the deadline either the initial 180-day deadline or an extended deadline granted by the director of oee would not be an additional violation of the ear, but such failure may reduce or eliminate the mitigating impact of the voluntary disclosure under supplement no. 1 to this part. for purposes of determining whether the deadline has been met under this paragraph, a complete narrative account must contain all of the pertinent information called for in paragraphs c 3 , c 4 , and c 5 of this section, and the voluntary self-disclosure must otherwise meet the requirements of this section. iv deadline extensions. the director of oee may extend the 180-day deadline upon a determination in his or her discretion that u.s. government interests would be served by an extension or that the person making the initial notification has shown that more than 180 days is reasonably needed to complete the narrative account. a conditions for extension. the director of oee in his or her discretion may place conditions on the approval of an extension. for example, the director of oee may require that the disclosing person agree to toll the statute of limitations with respect to violations disclosed in the initial notification or discovered during the review for or preparation of the narrative account, and or require the disclosing person to undertake specified interim remedial compliance measures. b contents of request. 1 in most instances 180 days should be adequate to complete the narrative account. requests to extend the 180-day deadline set forth in paragraph c 2 iii of this section will be determined by the director of oee pursuant to his or her authority under this paragraph c 2 iv based upon his consideration and evaluation of u.s. government interests and the facts and circumstances surrounding the request and any related investigations. such requests should show specifically that the person making the request i began its review promptly after discovery of the violations ii has been conducting its review and preparation of the narrative account as expeditiously as can be expected, consistent with the need for completeness and accuracy iii reasonably needs the requested extension despite having begun its review promptly after discovery of the violations and having conducted its review and preparation of the narrative account as expeditiously as can be expected consistent with the need for completeness and accuracy and iv has considered whether interim compliance or other corrective measures may be needed and has undertaken such measures as appropriate to prevent recurring or additional violations. 2 such requests also should set out a proposed timeline for completion and submission of the narrative account that is reasonable under the applicable facts and circumstances, and should also designate a contact person regarding the request and provide that contact person s current business street address, email address, and telephone number. requests may also include additional information that the person making the request reasonably believes is pertinent to the request under the applicable facts and circumstances. c timing of requests. requests for an extension should be made before the 180-day deadline and as soon as possible once a disclosing person determines that it will be unable to meet the deadline or the extended deadline where an extension previously has been granted, and possesses the information needed to prepare an extension request in accordance with paragraph c 2 iv b of this section. requests for extension that are not received before the deadline for completing the narrative account has passed will not be considered. parties who request an extension shortly before the deadline incur the risk that the director of oee will be unable to consider the request, determine whether or not to grant the extension, and communicate his or her decision before the deadline, and that any subsequently submitted narrative account will be considered untimely under paragraph c 2 iii of this section. 3 narrative account. after the initial notification, a thorough review should be conducted of all export-related transactions where possible violations are suspected. oee recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. if your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive consideration under this section. however, the failure to make such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the ear or other provision of law requires disclosure. upon completion of the review, oee should be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and gravity can be assessed. the narrative account should also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. the narrative account should include i the kind of violation involved, for example, a shipment without the required license or dealing with a party denied export privileges ii an explanation of when and how the violations occurred iii the complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violations iv license numbers v the description, quantity, value in u.s. dollars and eccn or other classification of the items involved and vi a description of any mitigating circumstances. 4 supporting documentation. i the narrative account should be accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, including a licensing documents such as licenses, license applications, import certificates and end-user statements b shipping documents such as shipper s export declarations, air waybills and bills of lading and c other documents such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other evidence of written or oral communications, internal memoranda, purchase orders, invoices, letters of credit and brochures. ii any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account must be retained by the person making the disclosure until oee requests them, or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been made. after a final decision, the documents should be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping rules in part 762 of the ear. 5 certification. a certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person s knowledge and belief. certifications made by a corporation or other organization should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization with the authority to do so. section 764.2 g of this part, relating to false or misleading representations, applies in connection with the disclosure of information under this section. 6 oral presentations. oee believes that oral presentations are generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and supporting documentation. if the person making the disclosure believes otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the disclosure. 7 where to make voluntary self-disclosures. the information constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure may be submitted to director, office of export enforcement, 1401 constitution ave., room h4514, washington, dc 20230, tel 202 482 5036, facsimile 202 482 5889. d action by the office of export enforcement. after oee has been provided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, it will acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making the disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional action, including further investigation, it deems appropriate. as quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, oee may take any of the following actions 1 inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action 2 issue a warning letter 3 issue a proposed charging letter pursuant to 766.18 of the ear and attempt to settle the matter 4 issue a charging letter pursuant to 766.3 of the ear if a settlement is not reached and or 5 refer the matter to the department of justice for criminal prosecution. e criteria. supplement no. 1 to part 766 describes how bis typically exercises its discretion regarding whether to pursue an administrative enforcement case under part 766 and what administrative sanctions to seek in settling such a case. f treatment of unlawfully exported items after voluntary self-disclosure. 1 any person taking certain actions with knowledge that a violation of the eaa or the ear has occurred has violated 764.2 e of this part. any person who has made a voluntary self-disclosure knows that a violation may have occurred. therefore, at the time that a voluntary self-disclosure is made, the person making the disclosure may request permission from bis to engage in the activities described in 764.2 e of this part that would otherwise be prohibited. if the request is granted by the office of exporter services in consultation with oee, future activities with respect to those items that would otherwise violate 764.2 e of this part will not constitute violations. however, even if permission is granted, the person making the voluntary self-disclosure is not absolved from liability for any violations disclosed nor relieved of the obligation to obtain any required reexport authorizations. 2 a license to reexport items that are the subject of a voluntary self-disclosure, and that have been exported contrary to the provisions of the eaa or the ear, may be requested from bis in accordance with the provisions of part 748 of the ear. if the applicant for reexport authorization knows that the items are the subject of a voluntary self-disclosure, the request should state that a voluntary self-disclosure was made in connection with the export of the commodities for which reexport authorization is sought."
764.6,"a license exception limitation. as provided in 740.2 b of the ear, all license exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, or revocation. b revocation or suspension of licenses. as provided in 750.8 of the ear, all licenses are subject to revision, suspension, or revocation. c temporary denial orders. bis may, in accordance with 766.24 of the ear, issue an order temporarily denying export privileges when such an order is necessary in the public interest to prevent the occurrence of an imminent violation. d denial based on criminal conviction. bis may, in accordance with 766.25 of the ear, issue an order denying the export privileges of any person who has been convicted of an offense specified in 11 h of the eaa."
764.7,"a introduction. as set forth in 764.2 e of this part, and restated in general prohibition ten at 736.2 b 10 of the ear, no person including a non-u.s. third party may order, buy, remove, conceal, store, use, sell, loan, dispose of, transfer, finance, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part, any item subject to the ear with knowledge that a violation has occurred, or will occur, in connection with the item. this section addresses the application of 764.2 e of this part to activities involving items subject to the ear that may have been illegally exported or reexported to libya before the comprehensive embargo on libya ended april 29, 2004 installed base items . b libya 1 activities involving installed base items in libya for which no license is required. subject to the reporting requirement set forth in paragraph b 1 ii of this section, activities within the scope of 764.2 e of this part involving installed base items described in paragraph b 1 i of this section that are located in libya and that were exported or reexported before april 29, 2004 do not require a license from bis. i scope. an installed base item is within the scope of paragraph b 1 of this section if a it is not on the commerce control list in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the ear b it is on the commerce control list, but is authorized for export or reexport pursuant to a license exception to libya or c it is on the commerce control list and controlled only for at reasons or for ns and at reasons only, and is not listed on the wassenaar arrangement s sensitive list annex 1 or very sensitive list annex 2 posted on the wassenaar arrangement s web site www.wassenaar.org at the control lists web page. ii reporting requirement. any person engaging in activity described in paragraph b 1 of this section must submit to bis s office of export enforcement oee a report including all known material facts with respect to how the installed base item arrived in libya. the report must be submitted to oee at the address identified in 764.4 a of the ear within ninety 90 days of the first activity relating to the installed base item in libya. a report may address more than one activity and or more than one installed base item. an additional report must be submitted if any new material information regarding the export or reexport to libya of the installed base item is discovered. 2 licensing procedure for activities involving installed base items in libya i license requirement. any person seeking to undertake activities within the scope of 764.2 e of the ear with respect to any installed base item located in libya and not described in paragraph b 1 i of this section must obtain a license from bis prior to engaging in any such activities. license applications should be submitted in accordance with 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the ear, and should fully describe the relevant activity within the scope of 764.2 e of this part which is the basis of the application. license applications should include all known material facts as to how the installed base item originally was exported or reexported to libya. this section also applies if you know that an item to be exported or reexported to a third party will be used on an installed base item not described in paragraph b 1 i of this section. ii licensing policy. bis will review license applications submitted pursuant to paragraph b 2 i of this section on a case-by-case basis. favorable consideration will be given for those applications related to civil end-uses in libya. applications related to military, police, intelligence, or other sensitive end-uses in libya will be subject to a general policy of denial. 3 exclusion. the provisions of this section are not applicable to any activities within the scope of 764.2 e of the ear undertaken with respect to an installed base item in libya by a person who was party to the original illegal export or reexport of the related installed base item to libya. such persons should voluntarily self-disclose violations pursuant to the procedures set forth in 764.5 of this part, which in some cases may allow activities related to unlawfully exported or reexported items to be undertaken based on permission from bis. 4 relationship to other libya license requirements. notwithstanding this section, a license may be required pursuant to another provision of the ear to engage in activity involving libya. if a license is required pursuant to another section of the ear, and the transaction also involves activity within the scope of 764.2 e of this part related to an installed base item in libya, this information should be specified on the license application. such applications must also include all known information as to how the installed base item originally arrived in libya. if granted, the license for the proposed transaction will also authorize the related activity within the scope of 764.2 e of this part."
764.8,"this section sets forth procedures for disclosing violations of part 760 of the ear restrictive trade practices or boycotts and violations of part 762 recordkeeping with respect to records related to part 760. in this section, these provisions are referred to collectively as the antiboycott provisions. this section also describes bis s policy regarding such disclosures. a general policy. bis strongly encourages disclosure to the office of antiboycott compliance oac if you believe that you may have violated the antiboycott provisions. voluntary self-disclosures are a mitigating factor with respect to any enforcement action that oac might take. b limitations. 1 this section does not apply to disclosures of violations relating to provisions of the ear other than the antiboycott provisions. section 764.5 of this part describes how to prepare disclosures of violations of the ear other than the antiboycott provisions. 2 the provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to oac for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under parts 764 and 766 of the ear for violations of the antiboycott provisions. 3 timing. the provisions of this section apply only if oac receives the voluntary self-disclosure as described in paragraph c 2 of this section before it commences an investigation or inquiry in connection with the same or substantially similar information it received from another source. i mandatory reports. for purposes of this section, oac s receipt of a report required to be filed under 760.5 of the ear that discloses that a person took an action prohibited by part 760 of the ear constitutes the receipt of information from another source. ii requests for advice. for purposes of this section, a violation that is revealed to oac by a person who is seeking advice, either by telephone or e-mail, about the antiboycott provisions does not constitute the receipt of information from another source. such revelation also does not constitute a voluntary self-disclosure or initial notification of a voluntary self-disclosure for purposes of this section. 4 although a voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by bis, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors in a case. the weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely within the discretion of bis, and the mitigating effect of voluntary self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. voluntary self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the department of justice for criminal prosecution. in such a case, bis would notify the department of justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the decision as to how to consider that factor is within the discretion of the department of justice. 5 a firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm s senior management or of a person with authority to make such disclosures on behalf of the firm. 6 the provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter. c information to be provided 1 general. any person wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify oac as soon as possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all transactions where violations of the antiboycott provisions are suspected. 2 initial notification. the initial notification must be in writing and be sent to the address in 764.8 c 7 of this part. the notification should include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations. the notification should describe the general nature and extent of the violations. if the person making the disclosure subsequently completes the narrative account required by 764.8 c 3 of this part, the disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date of the initial notification for purposes of 764.8 b 3 of this part. 3 narrative account. after the initial notification, a thorough review should be conducted of all business transactions where possible antiboycott provision violations are suspected. oac recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. if your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive the same mitigation as the violations voluntarily self-disclosed under this section. however, the failure to make such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the ear or other provision of law enforced by bis requires disclosure. upon completion of the review, oac should be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and gravity can be assessed. the narrative account should also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. the narrative account should include i the kind of violation involved, for example, the furnishing of a certificate indicating that the goods supplied did not originate in a boycotted country ii an explanation of when and how the violations occurred, including a description of activities surrounding the violations e.g., contract negotiations, sale of goods, implementation of letter of credit, bid solicitation iii the complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violations and iv a description of any mitigating factors. 4 supporting documentation. i the narrative account should be accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, including a copies of boycott certifications and declarations relating to the violation, or copies of documents containing prohibited language or prohibited requests for information b other documents relating to the violation, such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other evidence of written or oral communications, negotiations, internal memoranda, purchase orders, invoices, bid requests, letters of credit and brochures ii any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account must be retained by the person making the disclosure until the latest of the following the documents are supplied to oac bis informs the disclosing party that it will take no action bis issues a warning letter for the violation bis issues an order that constitutes the final agency action in the matter and all avenues for appeal are exhausted or the documents are no longer required to be kept under part 762 of the ear. 5 certification. a certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person s knowledge and belief. certifications made by a corporation or other organization should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization with the authority to do so. section 764.2 g of this part relating to false or misleading representations applies in connection with the disclosure of information under this section. 6 oral presentations. oac believes that oral presentations are generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and supporting documentation. if the person making the disclosure believes otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the disclosure. 7 where to make voluntary self-disclosures. the information constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure should be submitted to office of antiboycott compliance, 14th and pennsylvania ave., nw., room 6098, washington, dc 20230, tel 202 482 2381, facsimile 202 482 0913. d action by the office of antiboycott compliance. after oac has been provided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, it will acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making the disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional action, including further investigation, it deems appropriate. as quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, bis may take any of the following actions 1 inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action 2 issue a warning letter 3 issue a proposed charging letter and attempt to settle the matter pursuant to 766.18 of the ear 4 issue a charging letter pursuant to 766.3 of the ear if a settlement is not reached or bis otherwise deems appropriate and or 5 refer the matter to the department of justice for criminal prosecution. e criteria. supplement no. 2 to part 766 of the ear describes how bis typically exercises its discretion regarding whether to pursue an antiboycott administrative enforcement case under part 766 and what administrative sanctions to seek in settling such a case."
766.1,"a issuance. upon the application of any party, supported by a satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that the evidence would not otherwise be available, the administrative law judge will issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such books, records or other documentary or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the judge deems relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in scope. b service. subpoenas issued by the administrative law judge may be served in any of the methods set forth in 766.5 b of this part. c timing. applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least 10 days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, that extraordinary circumstances warrant a shorter time."
766.11,"a protective measures. it is often necessary for bis to receive and consider information and documents that are sensitive from the standpoint of national security, foreign policy, business confidentiality, or investigative concern, and that are to be protected against disclosure. accordingly, and without limiting the discretion of the administrative law judge to give effect to any other applicable privilege, it is proper for the administrative law judge to limit discovery or introduction of evidence or to issue such protective or other orders as in the judge s judgment may be consistent with the objective of preventing undue disclosure of the sensitive documents or information. where the administrative law judge determines that documents containing the sensitive matter need to be made available to a respondent to avoid prejudice, the judge may direct bis to prepare an unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. the administrative law judge may compare the extract or summary with the original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that it omits only so much as must remain classified or undisclosed. the summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record. b arrangements for access. if the administrative law judge determines that this procedure is unsatisfactory and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to avoid prejudice to a party, the judge may provide the parties opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive information. such arrangements may include obtaining security clearances, obtaining a national interest determination under section 12 c of the eaa, or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information and documents subject to assurances against further disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary."
766.12,"a the administrative law judge, on the judge s own motion or on request of a party, may direct the parties to participate in a prehearing conference, either in person or by telephone, to consider 1 simplification of issues 2 the necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings 3 obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof or 4 such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the proceedings. b the administrative law judge may order the conference proceedings to be recorded electronically or taken by a reporter, transcribed and filed with the judge. c if a prehearing conference is impracticable, the administrative law judge may direct the parties to correspond with the judge to achieve the purposes of such a conference. d the administrative law judge will prepare a summary of any actions agreed on or taken pursuant to this section. the summary will include any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties."
766.13,"a scheduling. the administrative law judge, by agreement with the parties or upon notice to all parties of not less than 30 days, will schedule a hearing. all hearings will be held in washington, d.c., unless the administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, that another location would better serve the interests of justice. b hearing procedure. hearings will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit attendance at any hearing or portion thereof to the parties, their representatives and witnesses if the judge deems this necessary or advisable in order to protect sensitive matter see 766.11 of this part from improper disclosure. the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the administrative law judge to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate weight. c testimony and record. witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation. a verbatim record of the hearing and of any other oral proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, transcribed and filed with the administrative law judge. a respondent may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy by paying any applicable costs. upon such terms as the administrative law judge deems just, the judge may direct that the testimony of any person be taken by deposition and may admit an affidavit or declaration as evidence, provided that any affidavits or declarations have been filed and served on the parties sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a party to file and serve an objection thereto on the grounds that it is necessary that the affiant or declarant testify at the hearing and be subject to cross-examination. d failure to appear. if a party fails to appear in person or by counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed, and that party s failure to appear will not affect the validity of the hearing or any proceedings or action taken thereafter."
766.14,"a at the request of a party, or on the judge s own initiative, the administrative law judge may certify to the under secretary for review a ruling that does not finally dispose of a proceeding, if the administrative law judge determines that immediate review may hasten or facilitate the final disposition of the matter. b upon certification to the under secretary of the interlocutory ruling for review, the parties will have 10 days to file and serve briefs stating their positions, and five days to file and serve replies, following which the under secretary will decide the matter promptly."

768.1,"where the secretary has removed national security controls on an item for foreign availability reasons, the secretary will also remove controls on similar items that are controlled for national security reasons and whose functions, technological approach, performance thresholds, and other attributes that form the basis for national security export controls do not exceed the technical parameters of the item that bis has decontrolled for foreign availability reasons."
768.2,"a foreign availability. foreign availability exists when the secretary determines that an item is comparable in quality to an item subject to u.s. national security export controls, and is available-in-fact to a country, from a non-u.s. source, in sufficient quantities to render the u.s. export control of that item or the denial of a license ineffective. for a controlled country, such control or denial is ineffective when maintaining such control or denying a specific license would not restrict the availability of items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of the controlled country or combination of countries detrimental to the national security of the united states see sections 5 a and 3 2 a of the eaa. b types of foreign availability. there are two types of foreign availability 1 foreign availability to a controlled country and 2 foreign availability to a non-controlled country."
768.3,"a foreign availability assessment. a foreign availability assessment is an evidentiary analysis that bis conducts to assess the foreign availability of a given item according to the assessment criteria, based on data submitted by a claimant, the data gathered by bis, and the data and recommendations submitted by the departments of defense and state and other relevant departments and agencies, tac committees, and industry. bis uses the results of the analysis in formulating its recommendation to the secretary on whether foreign availability exists for a given item. if the secretary determines that foreign availability exists, the secretary will decontrol the item for national security reasons or approve the license in question if there is no foreign policy reason to deny the license, unless the president exercises a national security override see 768.7 of this part . the effect of any such determination on the effectiveness of foreign policy controls may be considered independent of this part. b types of assessments. there are two types of foreign availability assessments 1 denied license assessment and 2 decontrol assessment. c expedited licensing procedures. see 768.8 of this part for the evaluation of eligibility of an item for the expedited licensing procedures."
768.4,"a assessment request. to initiate an assessment, each claimant or tac must submit a fas or a tac certification to bis. tacs are authorized to certify foreign availability only to controlled countries. claimants can allege foreign availability for either controlled or non-controlled countries. b denied license assessment. a claimant whose license application bis has denied, or for which it has issued a letter of intent to deny on national security grounds, may request that bis initiate a denied license assessment by submitting a foreign availability submission fas within 90 days after denial of the license. as part of its submission, the claimant must request that the specified license application be approved on the grounds of foreign availability. the evidence must relate to the particular export as described on the license application and to the alleged comparable item. if foreign availability is found, the secretary will approve the license for the specific items, countries, and quantities listed on the application. the denied license assessment procedure, however, is not intended to result in the removal of the u.s. export control on an item by incrementally providing a country with amounts that, taken together, would constitute a sufficient quantity of an item. the secretary will not approve on foreign availability grounds a denied license if the approval of such license would itself render the u.s. export control ineffective in achieving its purpose. in the case of a positive determination, the secretary will determine whether a decontrol assessment is warranted. if so, then bis will initiate a decontrol assessment. c decontrol assessment. 1 any claimant may at any time request that bis initiate a decontrol assessment by a fas to bis alleging foreign availability to any country or countries. 2 a tac may request that bis initiate a decontrol assessment at any time by submitting a tac certification to bis that there is foreign availability to a controlled country for items that fall within the area of the tac s technical expertise. 3 the secretary, on his her own initiative, may initiate a decontrol assessment. d bis mailing address. all foreign availability submissions and tac certifications should be submitted to department of commerce, bureau of industry and security, room h 1093, 14th street and pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20230."

768.6,"bis will evaluate the evidence contained in a fas or tac certification and all other evidence gathered in the assessment process in accordance with certain criteria that must be met before bis can recommend a positive determination to the secretary. the criteria are defined in 768.1 d of this part. in order to initiate an assessment, each fas and tac certification should address each of these criteria. the criteria are statutorily prescribed and are a available-in-fact b non-u.s. source c sufficient quantity and d comparable quality."
768.7,"a initiation of an assessment. 1 once bis accepts a fas or tac certification of foreign availability, bis will notify the claimant or tac that it is initiating the assessment. 2 bis will publish a 3 bis will notify the departments of defense and state, the intelligence community, and any other departments, agencies and their contractors that may have information concerning the item on which bis has initiated an assessment. each such department, agency, and contractor shall provide bis all relevant information concerning the item. bis will invite interested departments and agencies to participate in the assessment process see paragraph e of this section . b data gathering. bis will seek and consider all available information that bears upon the presence or absence of foreign availability, including but not limited to that evidence described in 768.5 b and c of this part. as soon as bis initiates the assessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including an analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries, technical analysis, and intelligence information from the departments of defense and state, and other u.s. agencies. evidence is particularly sought from industry sources worldwide other u.s. organizations foreign governments commercial, academic and classified data bases scientific and engineering research and development organizations and international trade fairs. c analysis. bis will conduct its analysis by evaluating whether the reasonable and reliable evidence that is relevant to each of the foreign availability criteria provides a sufficient basis to recommend a determination that foreign availability does or does not exist. d recommendation and determination. 1 upon completion of each assessment, bis, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that the secretary make a determination either that there is or that there is not foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. the assessment upon which bis bases its recommendation will accompany the recommendation to the secretary. 2 bis will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the secretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country when the available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality is available-in-fact to the country, from non-u.s. sources, in sufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing national security export control, or denial of the license application in question on national security grounds, would be ineffective in achieving its purpose. for a controlled country, such control or denial is ineffective when comparable items are available-in-fact from foreign sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining such control or denying a license would not be effective in restricting the availability of items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any country or combination of countries detrimental to the national security of the united states. 3 the secretary will make the determination of foreign availability on the basis of the bis assessment and recommendation the secretary s determination will take into account the evidence provided to bis, the recommendations of the secretaries of defense and state and any other interested agencies, and any other information that the secretary considers relevant. 4 for all decontrol and denied license assessments under section 5 f 3 of the eaa initiated by a fas, the secretary will make a determination within 4 months of the initiation of the assessment and will notify the claimant. the secretary will submit positive determinations for review to the appropriate departments and agencies. 5 the deadlines for determinations based on self-initiated and tac-initiated assessments are different from the deadlines for claimant-initiated assessments see paragraphs f 2 and f 3 of this section . e interagency review. bis will notify all appropriate u.s. agencies and departments upon the initiation of an assessment and will invite their participation in the assessment process. bis will provide all interested agencies and departments an opportunity to review source material, draft analyses and draft assessments immediately upon their receipt or production. for claimant-initiated assessments, bis will provide a copy of all positive recommendations and assessments to interested agencies and departments for their review following the secretary s determination of foreign availability. for self-initiated and tac-initiated assessments, bis will provide all interested agencies an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment. f notification. 1 no later than 5 months after the initiation of an assessment based on a fas claimant assessments , the secretary will inform the claimant in writing and will submit for publication in the i foreign availability exists, and a the requirement of a license has been removed or the license application in question has been approved or b the president has determined that for national security purposes the export controls must be maintained or the license application must be denied, notwithstanding foreign availability, and that appropriate steps to eliminate the foreign availability are being initiated or c in the case of an item controlled multilaterally under the former cocom regime, the u.s. government will conduct any necessary consultations concerning the proposed decontrol or approval of the license with the former cocom regime for a period of up to 4 months from the date of the publication of the determination in the ii foreign availability does not exist. 2 for all tac certification assessments, the secretary will make a foreign availability determination within 90 days following initiation of the assessment. bis will prepare and submit a report to the tac and to the congress stating that i the secretary has found foreign availability and has removed the license requirement or ii the secretary has found foreign availability, but has recommended to the president that negotiations be undertaken to eliminate the foreign availability or iii the secretary has not found foreign availability. 3 there is no statutory deadline for assessments self-initiated by the secretary or for the resulting determination. however, bis will make every effort to complete such assessments and determinations promptly. g foreign availability to controlled countries. when the secretary determines that an item controlled for national security reasons is available to a controlled country and the president does not issue a national security override nso , bis will submit the determination to the department of state, along with a draft proposal for the multilateral decontrol of the item or for the former cocom regime approval of the license. the department of state will submit the proposal or the license for former cocom regime review. the former cocom regime will have up to 4 months for review of the proposal. h foreign availability to non-controlled countries. if the secretary determines that foreign availability to non-controlled countries exists, the secretary will decontrol the item for export to all non-controlled countries where it is found to be available, or approve the license in question, unless the president exercises a national security override. i negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. 1 the president may determine that an export control must be maintained notwithstanding the existence of foreign availability. such a determination is called a national security override nso and is based on the president s decision that the absence of the control would prove detrimental to the united states national security. unless extended as described in paragraph i 7 of this section , an nso is effective for 6 months. where the president invokes an nso, the u.s. government will actively pursue negotiations with the government of any source country during the 6 month period to eliminate the availability. 2 there are two types of national security overrides i an nso of a determination of foreign availability resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5 f of the eaa claimant and self-initiated assessments and ii an nso of a determination of foreign availability resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5 h of the eaa tac-certification assessments . 3 for an nso resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5 f of the eaa, the secretary of any agency may recommend that the president exercise the authority under the eaa to retain the controls or deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability. 4 for an nso resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5 h of the eaa, the secretary of commerce may recommend that the president exercise the authority under the eaa to retain the controls notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability. 5 under an nso resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5 f of the eaa, the committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs of the senate and the committee on international relations of the house of representatives will be notified of the initiation of the required negotiations. the notice will include an explanation of the national security interest that necessitates the retention of controls. 6 under an nso resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5 f of the eaa, bis will publish notices in the i the secretary s determination of foreign availability ii the president s decision to exercise the nso iii a concise statement of the basis for the president s decision and iv an estimate of the economic impact of the decision. 7 the 6 month effective period for an nso may be extended up to an additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, the president certifies to congress that the negotiations are progressing, and determines that the absence of the controls would continue to be detrimental to the united states national security. 8 after the conclusion of negotiations, bis will retain the control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. if foreign availability is not eliminated, bis will decontrol the item by removing the requirement for a license for the export of the item to the destinations covered by the assessment. to the extent that the negotiations are successful and the foreign availability is eliminated, bis will remove the license requirement for the export of the item to any country that has agreed to eliminate foreign availability. j changes in foreign availability. if bis becomes aware of conditions, including new evidence, that affect a previous determination that foreign availability exists or does not exist, bis may review the conditions. if bis finds that the foreign availability previously determined no longer exists, or that foreign availability not earlier found now does exist, bis will make a recommendation to the secretary of commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. the secretary of commerce will make a determination, and bis will publish a"

770.3,"a introduction. this section is intended to provide you additional guidance on how to determine whether your technology or software would be eligible for a license exception, may be exported under nlr, or require a license, for export to country group d 1. b scope of licenses. the export of technology and software under a license is authorized only to the extent specifically indicated on the face of the license. the only technology and software related to equipment exports that may be exported without a license is technology described in 734.7 through 734.11 of the ear operating technology and software described in 740.13 a of the ear sales technology described in 740.13 b of the ear and software updates described in 740.13 c of the ear. c commingled technology and software. 1 u.s.-origin technology does not lose its u.s.-origin when it is redrawn, used, consulted, or otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other technology of any other origin. therefore, any subsequent or similar technical data prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is based on or utilizes any u.s.-origin technology, is subject to the ear in the same manner as the original u.s.-origin technology, including license requirements, unless the commingled technology is not subject to the ear by reason of the de minimis exclusions described in 734.4 of the ear. 2 u.s.-origin software that is incorporated into or commingled with foreign-origin software does not lose its u.s.-origin. such commingled software is subject to the ear is the same manner as the original u.s.-origin software, including license requirements, unless the commingled software is not subject to the ear by reason of the de minimis exclusions described in 734.4 of the ear. d certain license exception. the following questions and answers are intended to further clarify the scope of technology and software eligible for a license exception. 1 i question 1. a our engineers, in installing or repairing equipment, use techniques experience as well as proprietary knowledge of the internal componentry or specifications of the equipment that exceed what is provided in the standard manuals or instructions including training given to the customer. in some cases, it is also a condition of the license that such information provided to the customer be constrained to the minimum necessary for normal installation, maintenance and operation situations. b can we send an engineer with knowledge and experience to the customer site to perform the installation or repair, under the provisions of license exception tsu for operation technology and software described in 740.13 a of the ear, if it is understood that he is restricted by our normal business practices to performing the work without imparting the knowledge or technology to the customer personnel ii answer 1. export of technology includes release of u.s.-origin data in a foreign country as defined in 734.15 of the ear. so long as the circumstances described here would not exceed that permitted under the license exception tsu for operation technology and software, as described in 740.13 a of the ear, this is not a release of technology and a license would not be required. 2 i question 2. we plan, according to our normal business practices, to train customer engineers to maintain equipment that we have exported under a license, license exception, or nlr. the training is contractual in nature, provided for a fee, and is scheduled to take place in part in the customer s facility and in part in the u.s. can we now proceed with this training at both locations under a license exception ii answer 2. a provided that this is your normal training, and involves technology contained in your manuals and standard instructions for the exported equipment, and meets the other requirements of license exception tsu for operation technology and software described in 740.13 a , the training may be provided within the limits of those provisions of license exception tsu. the location of the training is not significant, as the export occurs at the time and place of the actual transfer or imparting of the technology to the customer s engineers. b any training beyond that covered under the provisions of license exception tsu for operation technology and software described in 740.13 a , but specifically represented in your license application as required for this customer installation, and in fact authorized on the face of the license or a separate technology license, may not be undertaken while the license is suspended or revoked."
774.1,"a scope of the control list. in this part, references to the ear are references to 15 cfr chapter vii, subchapter c. the bureau of industry and security bis maintains the commerce control list ccl that includes items i.e., commodities, software, and technology subject to the authority of bis. the ccl does not include items exclusively controlled for export by another department or agency of the u.s. government, though in instances where other agencies administer controls over related items, entries in the ccl may contain a reference to such controls. in addition, those items subject to the ear but not identified on the ccl are identified by the designator ear99. see 734.2 a of the ear for items that are subject to the ear. ear part 738 contains an explanation of the organization of the ccl and its relationship to the country chart. b eccn cross-references for items subject to exclusive jurisdiction of another agency. 1 prior to october 15, 2013, the ccl contained certain eccns that were only included as cross references to items subject to the export control regulations administered by the nuclear regulatory commission. 2 eccns formerly listed on the ccl that, as of october 15, 2013 were subject to the export licensing authority of the nuclear regulatory commission at 10 cfr part 110 are 0a001, 0b001, 0b002, 0b003, 0b004, 0b005, 0b006, 0c001, 0c002, 0c004, 0c005, 0c006, 0c201 and 1c012. 3 the following multilateral export control regime reference is provided, as an additional point of historical reference 0c201 infcirc 254 part 1, 5.3.1 b . c where to find the ccl the ccl is contained in supplement no. 1 to this part, and supplement no. 2 to this part contains the general technology and software notes relevant to entries contained in the ccl. d conventions related to the use of quotation marks on the ccl. the use of double quotation marks on the ccl is intended to be an aid to alert you to terms used on the ccl that are defined in part 772 definitions of terms , or for purposes of eccns, where a definition is provided in the related definitions paragraph in the license requirements section of eccns or sometimes in notes and technical notes for particular eccns and that definition is specific to that particular eccn. in this sense the quotes are helpful both in the use of single and double quotes, but a good compliance practice is to familiarize yourself with the defined terms in part 772, and when reviewing a control parameter on the ccl that uses a term that is not in quotes to be aware it may be defined in part 772. it is also a useful compliance practice to review the related definitions paragraph and notes and technical notes to determine if the term is defined for purposes of a particular eccn. 1 use of double quotes. if a term on the ccl uses double quotes it means there is a defined term in part 772. however, the absence of double quotes does not mean that a term used on the ccl is not defined in part 772. because the ccl includes many terms that are defined in part 772, bis s practice is to use double quotes for certain key terms and to use double quotes when needed for consistency with multilateral export control regime based entries, such as many derived from control lists, in particular for the wassenaar arrangement that also uses the double quotes convention. however, because of the large number of defined terms used on the ccl and a desire to avoid hindering readability by placing quotes around too many words used in particular eccns, bis s practice is to not add double quotes around certain terms, such as items and commodities. this convention also applies to the use of double quotes within the definition of terms section under part 772. 2 use of single quotes. the ccl also includes a convention regarding the use of single quotes. single quotes on the ccl identify a term as a defined term in the context of a particular eccn. this convention also applies to the use of single quotes within the definition of terms section under part 772. e chemicals identified by chemical abstracts service cas number. in some instances chemicals are listed by name and cas number. the list applies to chemicals of the same structural formula including hydrates regardless of name or cas number. cas numbers are shown to assist in identifying a particular chemical or mixture, irrespective of nomenclature. cas numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of the listed chemical have different cas numbers, and mixtures containing a listed chemical may also have different cas numbers."
