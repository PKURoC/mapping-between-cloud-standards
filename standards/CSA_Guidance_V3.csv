1,"cloud services exhibit five essential characteristics that demonstrate their relation to, and differences from, traditional computing approaches.on-demand self-service. a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with a service provider. broad network access. capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and pda s as well as other traditional or cloud-based software services.resource pooling. the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multitenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. there is a degree of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources, but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g., country, state, or datacenter . examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth, and virtual machines. even private clouds tend to pool resources between different parts of the same organization.rapid elasticity. capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. to the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time. measured service. cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, or active user accounts . resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the service."
2,provide transparency to stakeholders and shareholders demonstrating fiscal solvency and organizational transparency. respect the interdependency of the risks inherent in the cloud supply chain and communicate the corporate risk posture and readiness to consumers and dependant parties. inspect and account for risks inherited from other members of the cloud supply chain and take active measures to mitigate and contain risks through operational resiliency
3,"3.2.1 due diligence before entering into a cloud computing arrangement, a company should evaluate its own practices, needs, and restrictions, in order to identify the legal barriers and compliance requirements, associated with a proposed cloud computing transaction. for example, it should determine whether its business model allows for the use of cloud computing services, and under which conditions. the nature of its business might be such that any relinquishment of control over the company data is restricted by law or creates serious security concerns. in addition, the company should and in some cases may be legally required to conduct due diligence of the proposed cloud service provider, in order to determine whether the offering will allow the company to fulfill its continued obligation to protect its assets. 3.2.2 contract the parties must enter into a written contract. depending on the nature of the services, the contract may commonly be in the form of a click-wrap agreement, which is not negotiated or the parties may negotiate a more complex written document that is tailored to the specific situation. if a click-wrap agreement is the only agreement available, the cloud service client should balance the risks from foregoing negotiations against the actual benefits, financial savings, and ease of use promised by the cloud service provider. if the parties can negotiate a contract, they should ensure that the provisions of this contract address the needs and obligations of the parties both during the term of the contract and upon termination. detailed, comprehensive provisions, addressing the unique needs and risks of operating in a cloud environment, should be negotiated. if issues are not addressed in the contract, the cloud service customer should consider alternate means of achieving the goal, an alternate provider, or not sending the data to the cloud. for example, if the cloud service customer wishes to send hipaa-covered information to the cloud, the customer will need to find a cloud service provider that will sign a hipaa business associate agreement or else not send that data to the cloud. below are brief descriptions of some cloud-specific issues. in addition, the attached checklist provides a comprehensive but not exhaustive list of issues to consider when reviewing a cloud services contract. 3.2.3 monitoring, testing and updating the cloud environment is not static. it evolves, and the parties must adapt. periodic monitoring, testing, and evaluation of the services are recommended, in order to ensure that the required privacy and security measures are being used, and the processes and policies are being followed. in addition, the legal, regulatory, and technical landscape is likely to change at a rapid pace. new security threats, new laws, new compliance requirements must be addressed promptly. the parties must keep abreast of the legal and other requirements and ensure that the operations remain compliant with applicable laws, and that the security measures in place keep evolving as new technologies and new laws emerge. cloud audit and cloud trust protocol are two mechanisms to automate monitoring and testing of cloud supply chains. in addition, the itu-t is working on an x.1500 cloud auditing specification referred to as cybex."
4,"a right to audit clause gives customers the ability to audit the cloud provider, which supports traceability and transparency in the frequently evolving environments of cloud computing and regulation. use a normative specification in the right to audit to ensure mutual understanding of expectations. in time, this right should be supplanted by third-party certifications e.g., driven by iso iec 27001 27017 . a right to transparency clause with specified access rights can provide customers in highly regulated industries including those in which non-compliance can be grounds for criminal prosecution with required information. the agreement should distinguish between automated direct access to information e.g., logs, reports and pushed information e.g., system architectures, audit reports . providers should review, update, and publish their information security documents and grc processes regularly or as required . these should include vulnerability analysis and related remediation decisions and activities.third-party auditors should be mutually disclosed or selected in advance, jointly by provider and customer. all parties should agree to use a common certification assurance framework e.g., from iso, cobit for it governance and security controls."
5,"use the data security lifecycle to identify security exposures and determine the most appropriate controls. due to all the potential regulatory, contractual, and other jurisdictional issues it is extremely important to understand both the logical and physical locations of data. monitor employee internet access with url filtering and or dlp tools to identify sensitive data moving to the cloud. encrypt all sensitive data moving to or within the cloud at the network layer, or at nodes before network transmission. encrypt sensitive volumes in iaas to limit exposure due to snapshots or unapproved administrator access. encrypt sensitive data in paas applications and storage."
6,"6.3.1 interoperability recommendations hardware physical computer hardwarethe hardware will inevitably vary or change over time and \nfrom provider tprovider leaving unavoidable interoperability gaps if direct hardware access is required. whenever possible, use virtualization tremove many hardware level concerns, remembering that virtualization doesn t necessarily remove all hardware concerns, especially on current systems.if hardware must be directly addressed, it is important tensure that the same or better physical and administrative security controls exist when moving from one provider tanother.physical network devicesthe network devices including security devices will be different from service providers tservice providers along with its api and configuration process. tmaintain interoperability the network physical hardware and network & security abstraction should be in virtual domain. as far as possible api s should have the same functionally.virtualizationwhile virtualization can help tremove concerns about physical hardware, distinct differences exist between common hypervisors such as zen, vmware and others .using open virtualization formats such as ovf thelp ensure interoperability.document and understand which specific virtualization hooks are used nmatter the format. it still may not work on another hypervisor.frameworksdifferent platform providers offer different cloud application frameworks and differences dexist between them that affect interoperability.investigate the api s tdetermine where differences lie and plan for any changes necessary that may be required tapplication processing when moving ta new provider. use open and published api s tensure the broadest support for interoperability between components and tfacilitate migrating applications and data should changing a service provider become necessary.applications in the cloud often interoperate over the internet and outages can be anticipated toccur. determine how failure in one component or a slow response will impact others and avoid stateful dependencies that may risk system data integrity when a remote component fails.storagestorage requirements will vary for different types of data. structured data will most often require a database system, or require application specific formats. unstructured data will typically follow any of a number of common application formats used by word processors, spreadsheets and presentation managers. here the concern should be tmove data stored with one service tanother seamlessly.store unstructured data in an established portable format.assess the need for encryption for the data in transit.check for compatible database systems and assess conversion requirements if needed.securitydata and applications in the cloud reside on systems the user doesn t own and likely has only limited control over. a number of important items tconsider for interoperable security include use saml or ws-security for authentication sthe controls can be interoperable with other standards-based systems. see domain 12 for more detail.encrypting data before it is placed intthe cloud will ensure that it cannot be accessed inappropriately within cloud environments. see domain 11 for more detail on encryption. when encryption keys are in use, investigate how and where keys are stored tensure access texisting encrypted data is retained. see domain 11 for more detail on key management.understand your responsibilities and liabilities should a compromise occur due tunanticipated gaps in protection methods offered by your service provider.log file information should be handled with the same level of security as all other data moving tthe cloud. ensure that log files are interoperable tensure continuity of log analysis pre-and post move as well as compatibility with whatever log management system is in use.when completing a move ensure that all data, logs, and other information is deleted from the original system. 6.3.2 portability recommendationsthere are a number of issues standing in the path of moving tthe cloud. portability considerations and recommendations that impact moving tthe cloud include service level. sla s will differ across providers, and there is a need tunderstand how this may affect your ability tchange providers.different architectures. systems in the cloud may reside on disparate platform architectures. it is important tbe aware of how these will limit portability by understanding service and platform dependencies, which may include api s, hypervisors, application logic, and other restrictions.security integration. cloud systems introduce unique portability concerns for maintaining security, including authentication and identity mechanisms for user or process access tsystems now must operate across all components of a cloud system. using open standards for identity such as saml will help tensure portability. developing internal iam system tsupport saml assertions and internal system taccept saml will aid future portability of system tthe cloud.encryption keys should be escrowed locally, and when possible maintained locallymetadata is an aspect of digital information that is often and easily overlooked as typically metadata is not directly visible when working with files and documents. metadata becomes an important consideration in the cloud, because metadata moves with the document. when moving files and their metadata tnew cloud environments ensure copies of file metadata are securely removed tprevent this information from remaining behind and opening a possible opportunity for compromise. 6.3.3 recommendations for different cloud modelsthere are a number of generic risks and recommendations that are common tall cloud models.when substituting cloud providers it is normal texpect resistance from the legacy cloud provider. this must be planned for in the contractual process as outlined in domain 3, in your business continuity program as outlined in domain 7, and as a part of your overall governance in domain 2.understand the size of data sets hosted at a cloud provider. the sheer size of data may cause an interruption of service during a transition, or a longer transition period than anticipated. many customers have found that using a courier tship hard drives is faster than electronic transmission for large data sets.document the security architecture and configuration of individual component security controls sthey can be used tsupport internal audits, as well as tfacilitate migration tnew providers and aid the validation of the new environment."
7,"all parties must ensure proper structural design for physical security. all supply chain participants must respect the interdependency of deterrent, detective, and authentication solutions. end consumers must inspect, account for, and fix personnel risks inherited from other members of the cloud supply chain. they must also design and implement active measures to mitigate and contain personnel risks through proper separation of duties and least privilege access"
8,"fully understand control matrix requirements based upon what is going to run in the data center. use a common denominator that satisfies most application missions. use it service management techniques to ensure availability, security, and asset delivery and management. if the data center is owned by a provider, audit against a regulatory and security standard template and publish results to the customer."
9,"for each cloud-service provider that is used, the approach to detecting and handling incidents involving resources hosted at that provider must be planned and described in the enterprise incident response plan. the sla of each cloud-service provider that is used must guarantee the support for incident handling required for effective execution of the enterprise incident response plan for each stage of the incident handling process detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. testing will be conducted at least annually. customers should seek to integrate their testing procedures with that of their provider and other partners to the greatest extent possible. ideally, a team comprising customer and csp members should carry out various health check tests for an incident response plan, and accordingly, suggestions should be implemented into a new version of incident response plan."
10,"10.6.1 security assurance recommendationsfunctional and regulatory security and privacy requirements are defined that meet the needs of cloud development and or deployment.a detailed assessment of the attack vectors and risks in the cloud environment are understood, and the mitigations strategies are integrated intthe requirements.an impact assessment for all risks and attack vectors is undertaken, and documented, together with the potential for loss or damage from each scenario.security and privacy requirements and efforts should be prioritized on likelihood and impact. 10.6.2 risk analysis recommendationsrisk analysis of the applications for security and privacy confidentiality, integrity and availability are undertaken, and threat models should be built and maintained.risks from the perspective of development and deployment in the cloud should be analyzed and related threat models maintained.attack vectors and impact analysis specific tcloud architectures should be catalogued and maintained.traceability between security assurance features and all identified risks threats should be maintained. 10.6.3 architecture recommendationssecure software architecture frameworks should be developed and maintained.cloud computing architecture patterns that explicitly mitigate threats for example, from open security architecture 94 or togaf sabsa95 should be used.reusable building blocks in the application architecture are available for mitigating commonly known security and breach scenarios.cloud-specific secure data architectures should be used tenhance the chosen security architectural framework, which will address cloud specific issues and threats, such as the monitoring of dynamic database servers understanding where the database is exactly hosted at any point in time centrally logging all activity, across disparate potentially global systems tprovide a holistic view of the application and flag suspicious events define where encryption must be used see domain 12 provide adequate segregation of duties within the system, the data, and all privileged activities by third parties, capable of being monitored by staff of the organization that owns the data. 10.6.3 penetration testing applications on cloud recommendations carry out regular web application penetration testing tcheck for owasp top 10 vulnerabilitiescategorize vulnerabilities based on criticality impact and have a process for remediationcarry out manual tests from a multi-tenancy perspective tvalidate that privileges cannot be escalated or data segregated based on lack of session enforcement.for applications being migrated tan iaas or paas environment, a security assessment needs tbe carried out tensure that the underlying security controls such as vm zoning and segregation, virtualization security, etc. has been effectively put in place and does not pose a risk tthe application ecosystem."
11,"in order to maintain best practices and pass audits the organization should manage their keys in the custody of their own enterprise or that of a credible service from a cryptographic service provider. keys used in existing encryption technology such as drm and disk encryption products should be managed by central, internal to the enterprise, key storage technology. hardware security modules hsm should be used to store keys as well as process cryptographic operations such as encryption decryption, signing and verifying. enterprise users should go through a registration process to enable cryptographic operations and other processes in the enterprise, such as content aware or format preserving systems can access encryption decryption keys as needed. deploy technology integrated into corporate systems based on the identity of all components in the processing chain to make entitlement decisions. manage keys used by the cryptographic processes using binding cryptographic operations. use existing systems such as e-drm108 or dlp if possible. binding cryptographic operations and key management to corporate identity systems will provide the organization with the most flexible integration and uses technology that the organization already knows works and has been audited and or reviewed."
12,"implementers must design the common service layers to act independently to enable the removal of application silos without sacrificing existing information security policies and procedures. all cloud participants must respect the integrity of the supply chain and respect existing iam practices in place. elements such as privacy, integrity, and audit ability must be respected. identity integrity and audit must be preserved when moving data off-site and or decoupling the pillars of the solution into web service architecture."
13,"vm-specific security mechanisms embedded in hypervisor api s must be utilized to provide granular monitoring of traffic crossing vm backplanes, which will be opaque to traditional network security controls. implementers must update the security policy to reflect the new coming security challenges of virtualization. implementers must encrypt data accessed by virtual machines using policy-based key servers that store the keys separately from the virtual machine and the data. customers must be aware of multi-tenancy situations with your vm s where regulatory concerns may warrant segregation. users must validate the pedigree and integrity of any vm image or template originating from any third party, or better yet, create your own vm instances. virtualized operating systems must include firewall inbound outbound , host intrusion prevention system hips ,network intrusion prevention system nips ,web application protection, antivirus, file integrity monitoring, and log monitoring, etc. security countermeasures can be delivered via software in each guest virtual instance or by using an inline virtual machine combined with hypervisor-based api s. providers must clean any backup and failover systems when deleting and wiping the vm images. providers must have a reporting mechanism in place that provides evidence of isolation and raises alerts if there is a breach of isolation."
