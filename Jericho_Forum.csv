1,"the scope and level of protection should be specific and appropriate to the asset atrisk. business demands that security enables business agility and is cost-effective. whereas boundary firewalls may continue to provide basic network protection,individual systems and data will need to be capable of protecting themselves. in general, it s easier to protect an asset the closer protection is provided."
2,"security mechanisms must be pervasive, simple, scalable, and easy to manage. unnecessary complexity is a threat to good security. coherent security principles are required which span all tiers of the architecture. security mechanisms must scale from small objects to large objects. to be both simple and scalable, interoperable security building blocks need to becapable of being combined to provide the required security mechanisms."
3,"assume context at your peril. security solutions designed for one environment may not be transferable to work in another. thus, it is important to understand the limitations of any security solution. problems, limitations, and issues can come from a variety of sources, includinggeographic, legal, technical, acceptability of risk, etc."
4,"devices and applications must communicate using open, secure protocols. security through obscurity is a flawed assumption secure protocols demand open peer review to provide robust assessment and thus wide acceptance and use. the security requirements of confidentiality, integrity, and availability reliability should be assessed and built in to protocols as appropriate not added on. encrypted encapsulation should only be used when appropriate and does not solveeverything."
5,"all devices must be capable of maintaining their security policy on an un-trustednetwork. a security policy defines the rules with regard to the protection of the asset.internet e.g., will not rules must be complete with respect to an arbitrary context. any implementation must be capable of surviving on the rawbreak on any input."
6,"all people, processes, and technology must have declared and transparent levels of trust for any transaction to take place. trust in this context is establishing understanding between contracting parties to conduct a transaction, and the obligations this assigns on each party involved. trust models must encompass people organizations and devices infrastructure. trust level may vary by location, transaction type, user role, and transactional risk."
7,mutual trust assurance levels must be determinable. devices and users must be capable of appropriate levels of mutual authentication for accessing systems and data. authentication and authorization frameworks must support the trust model
8,"authentication, authorization, and accountability must interoperate exchange outside of your locus area of control. people systems must be able to manage permissions of resources and rights of users they don t control. there must be capability of trusting an organization, which can authenticate individuals or groups, thus eliminating the need to create separate identities. in principle, only one instance of person system identity may exist, but privacy necessitates the support for multiple instances, or one instance with multiple facets. systems must be able to pass on security credentials assertions. multiple loci areas of control must be supported."
9,"access to data should be controlled by security attributes of the data itself. attributes can be held within the data drm metadata or could be a separate system. access security could be implemented by encryption. some data may have public, non-confidential attributes. access and access rights have a temporal component."
10,"data privacy and security of any asset of sufficiently high value requires a segregation of duties privileges. permissions, keys, privileges, etc. must ultimately fall under independent control, or there will always be a weakest link at the top of the chain of trust. administrator access must also be subject to these controls."
11,"by default, data must be appropriately secured when stored, in transit, and in use. removing the default must be a conscious act. high security should not be enforced for everything appropriate implies varying levels with potentially some data not secured at all."
